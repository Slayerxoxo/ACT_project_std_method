corroborate 
the 
observation

suggest 
that

do 
have 
a 
role 
in

the

the

be 
the 
first 
report 
of 
alteration

patient 
although 
the

in 
our 
study 
show 
deletion 
about 
of 
case 
show 
amplification 
for 
the

it 
be 
speculate 
that 
deletion 
and 
amplification 
probably 
lead 
to 
insufficiency 
and 
overexpression 
respectively 
of 
in 
sporadic 
breast 
cancer 
suggest 
that 
a 
proper 
gene 
balance 
 
dosage 
of 
the 
gene 
may 
be 
critical 
for 
normal 
cellular 
function 
however 
it 
be 
show 
in 
a 
previous 
report 
that 
overexpression 
of

do 
not 
have 
any 
effect 
on

therefore 
the 
implication 
of 
overexpression 
 
amplification 
of 
gene 
still 
remain 
elusive 
our 
datum 
demonstrate 
a 
significant 
association 
between 
copy 
number 
alteration 
and 
and 
tumor 
furthermore 
when 
compare 
with 
deletion 
alone 
the 
trend 
be 
maintain 
and 
the 
histologic 
grade 
also 
show 
a 
positive 
association 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
do 
not 
obtain 
a 
very 
high 
significance 
value 
for 
histologic 
grade 
and 
tumor 
stage 
be 
probably 
because 
a 
number 
of 
tumor 
show 
alteration 
in 
early 
stage 
as 
well 
it 
be 
know 
that 
er 
and 
pr 
expression 
increase 
in 
the 
early 
stage 
of 
tumorigenesis 
and 
it 
can 
be 
speculate 
that 
dysregulation 
of 
hormone 
receptor 
expression 
together 
with 
alteration 
be 
an 
early 
force 
for 
uncontrolled 
proliferation 
lead 
to 
accumulation 
of 
threshold 
level 
of 
mutation 
require 
for 
tumor 
development 
whether 
the 
alteration 
in 
be 
an 
associate 
event 
or 
be 
a 
consequence 
of 
increase 
receptor 
expression 
remain 
to 
be 
explore 
there 
be 
however 
no 
correlation 
between 
alter 
copy 
number 
and 
the 
prevalence 
of 
somatic 
mutation 
which 
be 
generally 
know 
to 
occur 
in 
er 
 
tumor 
based 
on 
our 
preliminary 
result 
it 
be 
likely 
that 
mutation 
and 
alteration 
be 
involve 
in 
different 
step 
of 
breast

progression 
in 
conclusion 
the 
present

be 
the 
first

our

play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
the 
regulation 
of

we 
far 
test 
the 
downstream 
signaling 
pathway 
previous 
study 
have 
show 
that 
activate 
and 
 
heterodimer 
and 
induce 
the 
activation 
of 
downstream

pathway 
include 
and 
mapk 
pathway 
to 
investigate 
whether 
be 
mediate 
through 
the 
activation 
of 
this 
signaling 
pathway 
we 
test 
our 
hypothesis 
by 
use 
a 
low 
concentration 
m 
of 
different 
specific 
kinase 
inhibitor 
include 
mek 
inhibitor 
wortmannin 
a

a

and 
a

even 
at 
a

effectively 
block 
the

no

the

this

suggest 
that

the 
activation 
of

play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
the 
regulation 
of

thus 
we 
far 
test 
whether 
resveratrol 
suppress 
the 
activation 
of 
mapk 
 
erk 
signaling 
molecule 
to 
block 
the

as 
show 
in

we 
find 
that 
resveratrol 
at 
a 
low 
concentration 
of 
m 
significantly 
inhibit 
the 
activation 
of 
the 
mapk 
 
erk

pathway 
interestingly 
we 
also 
find 
a 
very 
low 
basal 
 
phosphorylation 
in 
cell 
although 
comparable 
total 
 
be 
detect 
datum 
not 
show 
it 
suggest 
that 
it 
compromise 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
resveratrol 
inhibit 
 
phosphorylation 
one 
plausible 
explanation 
be 
that 
we 
use 
the 
early

rather 
than 
the 
later

cell 
in 
this 
study 
we 
be 
currently 
investigate 
the 
discrepancy 
based 
on 
the 
different 
stage 
of 
cell 
this 
result 
suggest 
that 
resveratrol 
inhibit 
the 
activation 
of 
mapk 
 
erk 
molecule 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
absence

effect 
on

joint 
treatment 
of 
resveratrol 
and 
further 
slightly 
inhibit

on 
zymogram 
analysis 
therefore 
this 
result 
do 
not 
rule 
out 
the 
possibility 
that 
resveratrol 
also 
partially 
inhibit 
other 
signaling 
pathway 
and 
far 
block 
expression 
to 
test 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
resveratrol 
effectively 
suppress

in 
part 
through 
we 
investigate 
the

in 
this

resveratrol 
significantly

we 
also 
find 
that 
a

slightly 
induce

might 
suggest 
that 
resveratrol 
have 
agonistic

we 
be 
currently 
investigate 
this 
possibility 
to 
further 
confirm 
the 
anticarcinogenic

we 
investigate 
the

as 
show 
in

resveratrol

a

however

test 
the 
important

we 
examine 
whether 
resveratrol

as 
show 
in

resveratrol 
have 
a 
negligible

in 
human

cell 
we 
also 
find 
that 
slightly 
induce

of

suggest 
that

might 
correlate 
with 
the 
activation 
of

we 
be 
currently 
investigate 
the 
molecular 
mechanism 
of 
in 
mammary 
malignancy 
we 
demonstrate 
that 
resveratrol 
suppress 
expression 
as 
well 
as 
invasion 
of 
breast 
cancer 
recent 
study 
also 
indicate 
that 
resveratrol 
also 
fail 
to 
modulate 
other 
receptor 
tyrosine 
kinase 
such 
as 
vascular 
endothelial

factor 
it 
be 
consistent 
with 
our 
finding 
that 
resveratrol 
act 
as 
a 
chemotherapeutic 
agent 
in 
targeting 
intracellular 
signaling 
molecule 
thus 
resveratrol 
regulate 
activity 
in 
part 
through 
suppression 
of 
mapk

pathway 
previous

our 
result 
show 
that 
blockade 
of

contribute 
to 
the 
inhibition 
of

reduced 
activation 
of

by 
resveratrol 
correlate 
with 
the 
low

of

in 
the 
present 
study 
and 
recently 
suggest 
the 
anticancer

and 
therapeutic 
potential 
of 
resveratrol 
in

our 
previous 
study 
also 
indicate 
that 
phytochemical 
compound 
inhibit 
tumor 
angiogenesis 
and 
metastasis 
since 
resveratrol 
have 
long 
be 
demonstrate 
to 
have 
anticancer 
effect 
it 
be 
plausible 
that 
a 
mixture 
of 
this 
extract 
and 
resveratrol 
might 
be 
much 
effective 
than 
a 
single 
compound 
in 
suppress 
tumor 
growth 
invasion 
and 
metastasis 
in 
the 
present 
study 
we 
demonstrate 
that 
resveratrol 
inhibit

and 
blockade 
of

in

resveratrol

this

the 
discrepancy 
with

may 
be 
explain 
by 
the

further

we

be 
consistent

that

despite 
this 
consideration 
we 
should 
remember 
here 
that 
in 
our

the

the

be 
not 
a

parameter 
to

patient 
treat

at 
this 
point 
some 
consideration 
should 
be 
take 
into 
account 
the 
determination

alone 
be 
not 
sufficient 
for 
assess 
the 
of 
this

in 
the 
apoptosis 
pathway 
because 
it 
form

we

the

we 
observe 
that 
a

also 
correlated

therefore 
we 
believe 
that 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
determine 
the 
expression 
of 
all 
the 
other 
member 
of

we 
perform

to 
know 
if 
in 
our

we 
be 
recognize 
the

the

we 
corroborate 
that 
the

the

the

discuss 
the 
molecular

if 
this 
be 
true 
then 
the 
tumor 
cell 
with 
high

the

may 
be 
much 
sensitive 
to

explain 
the

however 
we 
should 
remember 
that 
the 
remain 
cell 
in 
the

after 
neoadjuvant

be 
mainly 
those 
that 
become

alternatively 
it 
be 
also 
possible 
that 
this

be 
not

and 
that 
if

chemotherapy

they 
will 
be 
the 
responsible 
of

and 
perhaps 
they 
will 
be 
the 
source 
for

we 
have 
examine 
the 
primary

but 
we 
do 
not 
know 
what 
be 
happen 
with 
the 
cell 
that 
already 
escape 
from 
the 
primary

we 
hypothesize 
that 
the 
breast 
tumor 
cell 
overexpressing 
become 
much 
resistant 
to 
chemotherapy 
at 
least 
this 
be 
what 
we 
see 
in 
the 
surgical 
specimen 
obtain 
after 
induction 
chemotherapy 
but 
they 
have 
a 
little 
aggressive 
behavior 
they 
be 
little 
able 
to 
produce

and 
for 
this 
reason 
primary 
tumor 
contain 
overexpression 
be 
relate 
to 
a 
well

this 
explanation 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
result 
obtain 
by 
et 
al. 
which 
may 
indicate 
that 
the

a 
marker

cancer 
with 
reduce 
capability 
of 
distant 
colonization 
even 
in 
presence 
of 
lymphovascular 
invasion 
in 
other 
word 
we 
be 
support 
the 
conclusion 
of 
bonetti 
et 
al. 
that 
positive 
tumor 
have 
low 
response 
to 
chemotherapy 
but 
well

one 
explanation 
may 
be 
the 
activity 
of

al. 
have 
show 
that 
may 
negatively 
regulate 
 
s 
transition 
by 
a 
mechanism 
involve 
the 
increase 
expression 
of 
antioxidant 
enzyme 
superoxide 
dismutase 
and

which 
in 
turn 
reduce 
intracellular 
reactive

and 
this 
be 
dependent 
of

status 
of 
then 
we 
examine 
the 
cell 
proliferation 
in

to 
know 
whether 
a 
tumor 
overexpressing

have 
low

we

we

finally 
the 
well

of 
the

this

the

whether

ability 
to

and 
attract

in 
practice 
the 
immune 
system 
and 
other 
host 
defense 
frequently 
fail 
to 
neutralize 
minimal

consequently 
local

perioperative 
factor 
shift 
the

the 
first 
be

the

which

the

furthermore 
morphine

consequently 
analgesia 
help 
preserve

regional 
anesthesia 
and 
analgesia 
attenuate 
or 
prevent 
each 
of 
this 
adverse 
effect 
for 
example 
regional 
anesthesia 
moderate 
the 
neuroendocrine 
stress 
response 
to 
surgery 
by 
block 
neural 
transmission 
from 
reach 
the 
central 
nervous 
system 
and 
activate 
the 
stress 
response 
and 
by 
block 
descend 
activation 
of 
the 
sympathetic 
nervous 
system 
as 
might 
thus 
be 
expect 
surgical 
stress 
be 
attenuate 
well 
by 
regional 
than 
by 
general 
anesthesia 
consequently 
nk 
cell 
function 
be 
well 
preserve 
and 
metastatic 
load 
to 
the 
lung 
be 
reduce 
with 
spinal 
analgesia 
in 
a 
rat 
model 
of 
breast 
cancer

when 
regional 
and 
general 
anesthesia

combine 
the 
amount 
of 
general 
anesthetic 
require 
be 
much 
reduce 
as 
be 
presumably 
immune 
suppression 
furthermore 
regional 
analgesia 
provide 
pain 
relief 
usually 
the 
need 
for 
postoperative 
opioid 
and 
their 
consequent 
adverse 
effect 
on 
immune 
function 
and 
promotion 
of 
tumor 
growth 
regional 
analgesia 
also 
reduce 
release 
of 
endogenous 
opioid 
available 
datum 
thus 
suggest 
that 
regional 
anesthesia 
and 
analgesia 
help 
preserve 
effective 
defense 
against 
tumor 
progression 
by 
attenuate 
the 
surgical 
stress 
response 
by 
reduce 
general 
anesthesia 
requirement 
and 
by 
spare 
postoperative 
opioid 
animal 
study 
be 
consistent 
with 
this 
theory 
show 
that 
regional

optimum 
postoperative 
analgesia 
independently 
reduce 
the 
metastatic 
burden

our 
theory 
paravertebral

analgesia 
for

associate 
with 
an 
approximately

the

by 
the

z. 
in 
this

framework 
consideration

the 
representation

some

to

impose 
in

to 
avoid 
different

that 
lead

this 
two 
condition

and 
ii 
for 
and 
note 
that 
this 
condition

not 
represent 
restriction 
on 
our 
model 
since 
it 
be 
possible 
to 
modify 
it 
so 
that 
it 
conform 
to 
this 
same 
condition 
the 
only 
purpose 
of 
the 
constraint 
be 
to 
define 
clearly 
which 
part 
of

fjk 
be 
the 
main 
effect 
and 
which 
part

be 
note 
that 
the 
model

be 
quite 
general 
and 
nest 
some 
interesting

i.e.

then 
obtain 
in 
recent 
year 
a 
number 
of

have 
appear 
which

discuss

among 
other 
propose

also

other 
work 
such

the

also 
use

additive

all 
the 
paper 
be 
mainly 
focused 
on

include 
and 
 
or 
interaction 
although 
we 
may 
find 
some 
statistical 
contribution 
to

wood 
allow 
for 
fitting 
this 
type 
of 
model 
in 
practice 
the 
of 
this 
model 
be 
still 
scarce 
main 
reason 
for 
this 
be 
a 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
close 
theory 
to 
address 
interesting 
issue 
such 
as 
either 
testing 
for 
interaction 
or 
construct 
confidence 
interval 
and 
b 
the 
practical 
difficulty 
in 
the 
final 
interpretation 
of 
the 
model 
the 
main 
goal 
of 
this 
paper 
be 
to 
propose 
nonparametric 
method 
for 
estimate 
and 
testing 
interaction 
in 
this 
type 
of 
model 
while 
retain 
their 
interpretation 
from 
a 
practical 
point 
of 
view 
for 
this 
aim 
we 
propose 
i 
a 
generalization 
of 
the 
procedure 
suggest 
recently 
by 
and 
for 
estimate 
and 
testing 
in 
the 
general 
model 
in 
eq. 
and 
also 
ii 
the 
use 
of 
the 
or 
curve 
to 
obtain 
a 
final 
biomedical 
interpretation 
of 
this 
model 
the 
propose 
estimation 
algorithm 
be 
an 
adapt 
version 
of 
the 
local 
scoring 
algorithm 
based 
on 
bivariate

for 
detect 
which 
bivariate 
continuous 
effect 
depended 
on 
the 
group 
associate 
with 
the 
factor 
we 
have 
use 
the 
likelihood 
test 
since 
no 
theory 
have 
be 
yet 
formulate 
in 
the 
field 
of 
hypothesis 
testing 
in 
this 
particular 
context 
we 
therefore 
suggest 
the 
use 
of 
the 
technique 
to 
approximate 
the 
distribution 
of 
the 
propose 
test 
it 
be 
know 
however 
that 
the 
use 
of 
bootstrap 
resampling 
technique 
involve 
estimate 
the 
model 
a 
great 
number 
of 
time 
and 
it 
be 
also 
a 
process 
in 
this 
connection 
reliance 
on 
the 
local 
linear 
bivariate 
kernel 
estimator 
have 
enable 
us 
to 
use 
binning 
technique 
fan 
and 
marron 
and 
wand 
which 
considerably 
reduce 
the 
computational 
time 
and 
render 
our 
procedure 
in 
practical 
situation 
especially 
when 
the 
sample 
size 
be 
very 
large 
the 
methodology 
develop 
in 
this 
work 
be 
employ 
in 
a 
diagnosis 
cad 
system 
dedicate 
to 
the 
early 
detection 
of 
breast 
cancer 
usually 
this 
system 
produce 
as 
a 
result 
suspicious 
area 
extract 
from 
the 
breast 
that 
may 
be 
recognize 
as 
true 
lesion 
or 
false 
detection 
characteristic 
of 
this 
area 
relate 
with 
brightness 
shape 
and 
be 
extract 
in 
term 
of 
continuous 
variable 
feature 
employ 
different 
image 
processing 
algorithm 
however 
the 
process 
of 
detect 
structure 
within 
an 
image 
be 
always 
influence 
by 
the 
contrast 
of 
the 
image 
contrast 
be 
one 
of 
the 
much 
important 
feature 
of 
an 
image 
and 
can 
be 
define 
as 
the 
difference 
in 
the 
image 
gray 
level 
scale 
between 
closely 
adjacent 
region 
contrast 
have 
a 
large 
influence 
on 
the 
of 
structure 
within 
a 
region 
be 
hard 
for 
human 
eye 
and 
computer 
to 
detect 
low 
contrast 
structure 
within 
a 
region 
of 
an 
image 
mammograms 
can 
be 
classify 
as 
dense 
high 
gray 
level 
value 
or 
fatty 
low 
gray 
level 
value 
in 
term 
of 
breast 
tissue 
therefore 
detection 
of 
suspicious 
area 
usually 
represent 
by 
relative 
high 
level 
value 
will 
be 
influence 
by 
the 
surround 
tissue 
of 
each 
area 
because 
the 
contrast 
of 
those 
suspicious 
area 
will 
be 
low 
in 
dense 
mammogram 
although 
this 
work 
will 
be 
focused 
on 
regression 
model 
for 
binary 
response 
all 
the 
procedure 
explain 
in 
this 
paper 
would 
be 
easily 
generalizable 
to 
any 
response

thus 
the

not

the

by

we

that

the

up

discussion 
here 
we 
provide 
evidence 
that 
dissemination

in 
mouse 
model 
of 
breast 
cancer 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
human

can 
occur

that

both 
finding 
should 
modify 
the 
prevail 
view 
that

a 
late

and 
that 
the

reflect 
a

which 
our

not

present 
at

in 
mouse 
micro

appear 
only 
much 
than 
week 
after 
transplantation 
of 
a 
transgenic

at 
least 
two 
possibility 
may 
account 
for 
this 
observation 
although 
we 
transplant 
the 
mammary 
tissue 
before 
expression 
of 
the 
transgene 
into 
recipient 
mouse 
which 
should 
result 
into 
peripheral

we

slow 
down 
systemic 
cancer

alternatively 
surgical 
removal 
of

at 
very 
early 
time 
point 
may 
cancer 
cell 
from

for

such 
factor

from 
the 
primary 
tumor 
may 
prepare 
the 
metastatic 
niche 
and 
foster 
early 
cancerous 
colony 
as 
recently 
suggest 
thus 
large 
primary 
breast 
cancer 
in 
patient 
may 
support 
metastasis 
not 
by 
seed 
much 
cancer 
cell 
but 
by 
provide 
unknown 
systemically 
act 
factor 
that 
stimulate 
colonization 
of 
previously 
disseminate 
tumor 
cell 
at 
the 
ectopic 
site 
this 
reasoning 
be 
back 
by 
finding 
that 
patient 
with 
small 
tumor 
harbor 
similar 
number 
of 
disseminate 
cancer 
cell 
as 
patient 
with 
late 
stage 
tumor 
to 
present 
in 
our 
cohort 
of 
patient 
in 
a 
of 
several 
study 
on 
dtc 
in 
breast 
cancer 
employ 
however 
rather 
different 
technique 
for 
dtc 
detection 
but 
much 
than 
patient 
braun 
and 
coworkers 
observe 
an 
increase 
of 
positive 
bone 
marrow 
sample 
from 
in 
stage 
to 
in 
stage 
this 
datum 
give 
far 
support 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
large 
tumor 
in 
relation 
to 
small 
tumor 
seed 
far 
little 
tumor 
cell 
to 
bone 
marrow 
on 
average 
primary 
tumor 
comprise 
about 
time 
much 
cancer 
cell 
than 
tumor 
but 
the 
percentage 
of 
patient 
with 
dtc 
in 
bone 
marrow 
increase 
only 
marginally 
thus 
the 
poor 
prognosis 
of 
patient 
with 
breast 
cancer 
be 
explain 
by 
increased 
dtc 
number 
but 
so 
far 
unknown 
external 
trigger 
may 
be 
responsible 
for 
metastatic 
outgrowth 
that 
currently 
be 
rather 
underestimate 
in 
this 
context 
it 
be 
noteworthy 
that 
while 
the 
high 
number 
of 
dtc 
in 
bone 
marrow 
during 
the 
lifetime 
of

origin 
since 
the

take 
from

this 
suggest 
that 
the 
tumor 
cell 
may 
be 
release 
from 
dormancy 
or 
some 
type 
of 
as 
consequence 
of 
the 
stimulatory 
microenvironment 
during 
repopulation 
of 
the

out 
though 
the 
finding 
of 
microinvasion 
at 
the 
stage 
of 
adh 
may 
not 
apply 
to 
all 
patient 
with 
breast 
cancer 
the 
detection 
itself 
of 
disseminate 
cancer 
cell 
in 
dcis 
suggest 
that 
conventional 
histopathological 
analysis 
may 
miss 
tumor 
spread 
in 
human 
cancer 
as 
well 
although 
very 
rare 
metastasis 
in

patient 
have 
be

despite

other 
clinical 
finding 
such 
as

as

undiagnosed

be 
equally 
consistent 
with 
early

and 
potential 
metastatic 
outgrowth 
taken 
together 
our 
finding

a 
concept 
of

progression 
accord 
to 
which 
metastatic 
dissemination

a 
distinct

not 
sufficient 
for 
metastatic

the 
interaction 
of 
cancer

their 
ectopic 
microenvironment

to 
selection 
or 
adaptation

an 
early 
metastatic 
niche 
be 
ill

hypothesis

be 
raise 
about 
the 
efficacy 
of 
chemotherapy 
in 
breast 
cancer 
in

study 
suggest 
that 
the 
presence 
of

reduce 
the 
uptake 
and 
cytotoxic 
activity 
of 
fluorouracil 
and 
in 
breast 
cancer 
cell 
an 
observational 
study 
on 
woman 
with 
advance 
disease 
conclude 
that 
an 
objective 
response 
to 
chemotherapy 
be 
much 
likely 
in 
than 
in 
but 
later 
study 
do 
not 
replicate 
this 
find 
and 
conclude 
either 
that 
the 
response 
to 
chemotherapy 
do 
not 
correlate 
with 
or 
even 
that 
it 
be 
increase 
by 
a 
of 
the

of 
perioperative 
polychemotherapy

about 
patient

indicate 
an 
effect 
on 
survival 
that 
be 
little 
definite 
than 
in 
the 
trial 
of 
much 
prolong 
polychemotherapy 
this 
pect 
trial 
include 
both 
premenopausal

postmenopausal 
woman 
irrespective

do 
not

adjuvant 
tamoxifen

trial 
however 
recurrence 
be

only 
in 
the 
subgroup 
of 
postmenopausal 
woman 
who 
have 
disease. 
in 
view 
of 
this 
it 
be 
suggest 
that 
chemotherapy 
might 
be 
particularly 
effective 
in 
old 
woman 
with

to

the 
ground 
that

this 
be 
the 
of 
the

the 
first 
approach 
have 
the 
advantage 
of 
simplicity 
but 
it 
also 
have 
the 
disadvantage 
of 
small

larger

if 
the

the

one 
reason

the

it

the 
process

have 
a 
temporary 
effect 
that 
put

in 
this 
neighborhood 
at 
a 
high

late

woman 
in

whether 
this

temporary 
be 
an 
empirical 
finding 
deserving 
of

there

limitation

be 
that

we

this

an

thus

this 
be

that

do 
not

it

it

indication 
that

this

this

explain

possible 
explanation

that

hand 
none 
of 
the 
sociodemographic 
characteristic 
be

taken 
together 
this 
result 
suggest 
that 
although 
socioeconomic 
status 
may 
increase 
chamorro 
woman 
access 
to

service 
it 
may 
not

this

example 
know 
that

the

the

nevertheless 
the

they

in 
the

cd

it

thus 
cd 
like

to 
induce 
a

both 
the 
early

possibly 
involve

besides 
the

cell 
the

similarly 
in

report 
that

that

different

it

that

an 
important

be 
that

in 
conclusion 
the 
result 
present 
here 
provide 
evidence 
that 
micromolar 
concentration 
of 
cd 
rapidly 
activate 
 
and 
akt 
in 
the 
and 
cell 
this 
process 
seem 
to 
involve 
mer 
and 
it 
be 
plausible 
that 
cd 
also 
bind

further

today 
be

intuitively 
it 
make 
sense 
that

shape 
the

of

with

in 
this 
article 
i 
consider 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
woman 
embrace 
the 
survivor 
identity 
follow 
breast 
cancer 
treatment 
i 
begin 
with 
an 
overview 
of 
the 
dominant 
representation 
of 
breast 
cancer 
survivor 
and 
the 
criticism 
of 
this 
representation 
i 
then 
summarize 
two 
complementary 
approach 
for 
understanding 
how 
construction 
of 
breast 
cancer 
affect 
woman 
the 
first 
approach 
posit 
that 
survivorship 
be 
a 
tool 
that 
woman 
can 
use 
to 
frame 
their 
disease 
experience 
swidler 
and 
swidler 
according 
to 
the 
second 
approach 
survivorship 
be 
craftwork 
whereby 
woman 
construct 
their 
life 
and 
the 
meaning 
of 
cancer 
after 
describe 
my 
research 
method 
i 
provide 
datum 
from 
interview 
with 
woman 
in 
the 
united 
state 
who 
recently 
complete 
treatment 
for 
breast 
cancer 
in 
the 
datum 
present 
here 
a 
number 
of 
woman 
do 
embrace 
the 
survivor 
identity 
other 
woman 
craft 
new 
meaning 
of 
survivorship 
additionally 
some 
woman 
explicitly 
reject 
the 
label 
for 
fail 
to 
account 
for 
the 
possibility 
of 
recurrence 
for 
be 
heroic 
or 
for 
be 
too 
public 
of 
an 
identity 
i 
discuss 
the 
implication 
of 
this 
finding 
for 
woman 
with 
breast 
cancer 
and 
for 
the 
sociology 
of

in

the

within

such

would 
contribute

follow

would 
augment 
the

in

key 
way 
first 
although 
the 
sociology 
of 
health 
and

have 
examine 
the 
impact 
of 
cultural

for 
the

experience 
bury 
charmaz 
charmaz 
conrad

karp 
and 
this 
research 
have 
overwhelmingly 
focused

reynolds

thus 
we 
know 
little 
about

cultural

intuitively 
positive

should 
facilitate 
healthy 
adjustment 
by 
produce 
feeling

social 
worth 
however 
the 
criticism 
of

shed 
doubt 
on 
the 
benefit 
of 
the

thus 
prior 
to 
consider 
possible 
psychological 
benefit 
of 
the

identity 
qualitative 
research 
be

to

embrace 
this

we 
have

a 
great

role 
but 
have 
pay 
little 
attention 
to

from 
illness 
in 
particular 
cancer 
patient 
who 
live 
with 
the

represent

this 
work 
attempt 
to 
clarify 
woman 
relationship 
to 
the 
survivor 
identity 
next 
i 
discuss 
two 
theoretical 
framework 
for 
conceptualize 
woman 
relationship 
to 
survivorship 
survivorship 
as 
a 
cultural 
tool 
and 
survivorship 
as 
craftwork 
the 
cultural 
sociology 
of 
and 
provide 
a 
framework 
for 
conceptualize 
how 
the 
meaning 
of 
survivorship 
impact 
woman 
with 
breast 
cancer 
according 
to 
swidler 
individual 
possess 
knowledge 
of 
a 
variety 
of 
cultural 
meaning 
in 
talk 
of 
love 
swidler 
be 
interested 
in 
how 
people 
use 
some 
cultural 
material 
while 
reject 
other 
especially 
as 
they 
attempt 
to 
retool 
their 
life 
follow 
a 
major 
life 
event 
or 
transition 
the 
identity 
of 
breast 
cancer 
survivor 
can 
be 
conceive 
of 
as 
a 
tool 
that 
woman 
use 
to 
become 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
person 
give 
the 
disruption 
and 
bring 
by 
cancer 
and 
stam 
and 
nelson 
it 
make 
sense 
that 
woman 
would 
use 
survivorship 
to 
organize 
the 
self 
and 
life 
furthermore 
accord 
to 
swidler 
p. 
becoming 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
person 
be 
learn 
practiced 
and 
sustain 
through 
culture 
for 
the 
woman 
with 
breast 
cancer 
culture 
provide 
clear 
guideline 
for 
what 
it 
mean 
to 
be 
a 
survivor 
as 
well 
as 
opportunity 
e.g. 
breast 
cancer 
walk 
to 
practice 
be 
a 
survivor 
however 
if 
woman 
question 
or 
reject 
survivorship 
it 
be 
unclear 
what 
alternative 
meaning 
they 
embrace 
give 
that 
other 
image 
of 
breast 
cancer 
be 
largely 
negative 
or 
little 
available 
if 
survivorship 
be 
deem 
an 
inadequate 
cultural 
tool 
woman 
may 
work 
to 
construct 
alternative 
meaning 
in 
other 
word 
they 
may 
enact 
survivorship 
as 
craftwork 
according 
to 
frank 
p. 
survivorship 
as 
craftwork 
be 
the 
embody 
exacting 
skill 
of 
building 
something 
or 
make 
something 
work 
in 
a 
precise 
way 
much 
importantly 
craftwork 
require 
practice 
and 
the 
construction 
of 
one 
life 
frank 
be 
primarily 
interested 
in 
how 
individual 
construct 
the 
role 
of 
service 
for 
other 
follow 
cancer 
i 
extend 
his 
notion 
of 
craftwork 
to 
include 
the 
craft 
of 
the 
meaning 
of 
survivorship 
together 
swidler 
and 
frank 
conception 
of 
cultural 
tool 
and 
craftwork 
provide 
a 
conceptual 
framework 
for 
understanding 
how 
individual 
may 
embrace 
or 
reject 
survivorship 
or 
actively 
construct 
meaning 
follow 
cancer 
thus 
in 
this 
article 
i 
consider 
two 
question 
first 
do 
woman 
embrace 
the 
survivor 
identity 
as 
a 
way 
to 
make 
sense 
of 
their 
life 
follow 
cancer 
and 
second 
to 
what 
extent 
do 
woman 
craft 
new 
meaning 
for 
their 
experience 
method 
data 
come 
from

datum 
be 
extract 
from 
each 
interview 
to 
create 
a 
complete 
picture 
of 
each 
woman 
view 
of 
survivorship 
and 
to 
examine 
pattern 
across 
woman 
initially 
each 
woman 
transcript 
be 
code 
into 
one 
of 
two 
who 
identify 
as 
survivor 
and 
those 
who 
do 
not 
among 
those 
who 
reject 
survivorship 
three 
distinct 
reason 
for 
reject 
the 
identity 
quickly 
emerge 
in 
the 
datum 
additional 
work 
with 
the 
datum 
reveal 
that 
among 
the 
woman 
who 
identify 
as 
survivor 
some 
embrace 
the 
dominant 
meaning 
of 
survivorship 
and 
other 
express 
towards 
survivorship 
deeper 
analysis 
of 
the 
latter 
group 
reveal 
that 
they 
often 
modify 
the 
meaning 
of 
survivorship 
thus 
in 
my 
discussion 
of 
woman 
who 
accept 
survivorship 
i 
distinguish 
woman 
who 
embrace 
survivorship 
and 
those 
who 
identify 
as 
survivor 
but 
alter 
the 
meaning 
of 
survivorship 
result 
the 
survivor 
identity 
rarely 
do 
woman 
spontaneously 
refer 
to 
themselves 
as 
survivor 
instead 
the 
title 
of 
survivor 
be 
typically 
use 
to 
describe 
other 
for 
example 
a 
woman 
might 
say 
my 
aunt 
be 
a 
survivor 
when 
ask 
do 
you 
refer 
to 
yourself 
as 
a 
survivor 
twenty 
woman 
say 
yes 
even 
among 
the 
woman 
who 
identify 
as 
survivor 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
survivor 
identity 
vary 
some 
woman 
clearly 
embrace 
the 
dominant 
meaning 
of 
survivorship 
mary 
age 
year 
be 
one 
such 
woman 
when 
ask 
if 
she 
referred 
to 
herself 
as 
a 
cancer 
survivor 
mary 
reply 
with 
confidence 
and 
without 
a 
survivor 
she 
explain 
that 
be 
a 
survivor 
mean 
beat 
it 
you 
be 
strong 
you 
win 
the 
battle 
it 
not 
hard 
to 
imagine 
mary 
at 
a 
breast 
cancer 
fundraising 
event 
don 
a 
pink 
survivor 
hat 
to 
proudly 
and 
publicly 
mark 
herself 
as 
a 
breast 
cancer 
survivor 
visually 
embody 
an 
identity 
not 
otherwise 
apparent 
klawiter 
p. 
consistent 
with 
swidler 
that 
our 
use 
of 
culture 
be 
much 
obvious 
during 
period 
of 
life 
mary 
new 
cultural 
skill 
be 
exaggerate 
not 
only 
do 
she 
proudly 
declare 
herself 
a 
survivor 
but 
she 
also 
describe 
the 
breast 
cancer 
pin 
and 
ribbon 
she 
own 
she 
exhibit 
a 
careful 
use 
of 
culture 
by 
the 
definition 
of 
survivorship 
create 
by 
the 
national 
cancer 
survivor 
be 
a 
survivor 
from 
the 
day 
you 
be 
diagnose 
other 
woman 
in 
the 
sample 
draw 
much 
selectively 
from 
the 
survivor 
discourse 
age 
year 
see 
herself 
as 
a 
survivor 
because 
she 
be 
strong 
enough 
to 
make 
it 
through 
the 
experience 
she 
say 
it 
a 
test 
really 
of 
how 
strong 
you 
be 
and 
for 
me 
how 
strong 
my 
faith 
be 
a 
respondent 
name 
kim 
age 
year 
feel 
proud 
to 
be 
a 
survivor 
during 
the 
breast 
cancer 
walk 
she 
attend 
each 
year 
according 
to 
kim 
i 
think 
i 
be 
proud 
that 
i 
survive 
it 
i 
fall 
apart 
i 
find 
an 
inner 
strength 
she 
explain 
there 
be 
part 
of 
me 
that 
be 
go 
but 
there 
be 
something 
else 
that 
come 
in. 
the 
surgeon 
might 
have 
take 
a 
but 
he 
give 
me 
a 
different 
something 
have 
happen 
to 
quiet 
little 
kim 
by 
say 
she 
find 
an 
inner 
strength 
kim 
story 
fit 
the 
quest 
bring 
out 
new 
aspect 
of 
herself 
make 
her 
a 
well 
person 
than 
she 
be 
before 
frank 
and 
lisa 
age 
year 
say 
that 
she 
absolutely 
identify 
herself 
as 
a 
survivor 
like 
the 
woman 
quote 
above 
she 
feel 
pride 
for 
have 
the 
strength 
to 
make 
it 
through 
treatment 
and 
proudly 
wear 
pink 
symbol 
of 
breast 
cancer 
however 
lisa 
poignantly 
describe 
her 
ongoing 
fear 
of 
ache 
and 
pain 
i 
have 
i 
think 
wonder 
what 
this 
be 
i 
feel 
like 
an 
buoy 
in 
a 
large 
body 
of 
water 
because 
when 
in 
chemo 
you 
feel 
like 
something 
be 
kill 
it 
but 
now 
on 
my 
own 
out 
there 
and 
i 
take 
tamoxifen 
because 
it 
will 
be 
no 
good 
for 
me 
so 
i 
feel 
a 
little 
bit 
like 
a 
buoy 
in 
rough 
water 
i 
feel 
like 
i 
get 
throw 
around 
a 
little 
bit 
by 
the 
wave 
of 
life 
you 
know 
and 
it 
for 
me 
that 
way 
the 
notion 
of 
beat 
cancer 
and 
fear 
that 
cancer 
linger 
be 
contradictory 
how 
be 
lisa 
able 
to 
identify 
as 
a 
survivor 
while 
believe 
that 
cancer 
may 
be 
behind 
every 
ache 
and 
pain 
one 
possibility 
be 
that 
lisa 
have 
not 
thoroughly 
examine 
her 
use 
of 
culture 
and 
in 
her 
view 
go 
unnoticed 
rather 
lisa 
use 
a 
very 
specific 
definition 
of 
survivorship 
that 
allow 
for 
her 
linger 
fear 
lisa 
definition 
entail 
see 
cancer 
as 
an 
ongoing 
survivorship 
mean 
i 
have 
win 
a 
huge 
battle 
in 
a 
war 
that 
will 
last 
the 
rest 
of 
my 
life 
lisa 
have 
adopt 
a 
definition 
of 
survivorship 
that 
acknowledge 
her 
successful 
treatment 
and 
her 
fear 
of 
recurrence 
brooke 
construction 
of 
survivorship 
be 
far 
remove 
from 
the 
dominant 
meaning 
brooke 
age 
year 
initially 
see 
survivorship 
as 
empower 
and 
feel 
part 
of 
a 
great 
of 
people 
her 
feeling 
develop 
in 
part 
from 
the 
character 
from 
sex 
in 
the 
city 
successfully 
undergo 
treatment 
for 
breast 
cancer 
however 
brooke 
identification 
with 
survivorship 
as 
she 
allow 
herself 
to 
notice 
breast 
cancer 
death 
around 
her 
such 
as 
an 
she 
read 
on 
the 
morning 
of 
her 
interview 
brooke 
confidence 
in 
her 
ability 
to 
survive 
cancer 
have 
be 
shake 
however 
she 
craft 
new 
meaning 
around 
survivorship 
that 
enable 
her 
to 
retain 
the 
survivor 
identity 
she 
explain 
what 
be 
a 
survivor 
mean 
to 
her 
come 
from 
a 
really 
family 
and 
be 
a 
survivor 
long 
before 
i 
become 
a 
cancer 
survivor 
i 
have 
a 
really 
screw 
up 
mother 
from 
her 
i 
do 
with 
her 
while 
i 
have 
my 
treatment 
and 
it 
be 
so 
no 
long 
communicate 
with 
her 
but 
one 
of 
the 
thing 
think 
about 
it 
not 
so 
much 
be 
a 
cancer 
survivor 
it 
be 
a 
survivor 
in 
general 
i 
mean 
cancer 
be 
just 
one 
much 
thing 
i 
add 
to 
the 
i 
on 
the 
term 
cancer 
survivor 
i 
do 
much 
before 
but 
now 
this 
be 
just 
one 
much 
notch 
on 
the 
survival 
emphasis 
add 
because 
brooke 
alter 
the 
meaning 
of 
survivorship 
to 
fit 
her 
personal 
biography 
and 
as 
someone 
who 
have 
overcome 
difficulty 
survivorship 
retain 
significance 
for 
her 
like 
brooke 
a 
name 
lauren 
also 
fear 
a 
recurrence 
of 
breast 
mean 
the 
one 
thing 
i 
just 
stand 
be 
when 
people 
say 
oh 
so 
cure 
like 
people 
get 
it 
there 
be 
no 
cure 
if 
i 
die 
of 
a 
heart 
attack 
at 
know 
i 
be 
cure 
of 
breast 
cancer 
but 
the 
rest 
of 
my 
life 
be 
a 
question 
mark 
you 
never 
know 
if 
it 
will 
come 
back 
and 
labeled 
the 
threat 
of 
cancer 
recurrence 
the 
syndrome 
after 
the 
character 
from 
who 
be 
beneath 
a 
suspend 
by 
a 
single 
hair 
lauren 
life 
with 
cancer 
as 
an 
feature 
of 
her 
life 
nonetheless 
she 
see 
herself 
as 
a 
survivor 
her 
definition 
of 
survivorship 
center 
on 
have 
do 
her 
good 
to 
fight 
think 
it 
just 
mean 
i 
do 
all 
the 
treatment 
i 
do 
and 
done 
everything 
i 
can 
to 
keep 
it 
from 
come 
back 
and 
go 
to 
live 
my 
life 
like 
whatever 
happen 
be 
go 
to 
happen 
but 
i 
walk 
around 
say 
it 
not 
go 
to 
come 
back 
if 
i 
let 
my 
guard 
down 
too 
much 
that 
if 
it 
do 
come 
back 
be 
totally 
throw 
for 
a 
loop 
so 
i 
always 
leave 
like 
a 
little 
thing 
in 
my 
mind 
that 
it 
come 
back 
this 
datum 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
group 
of 
woman 
who 
identify 
as 
survivor 
include 
woman 
who 
feel 
they 
have 
beat 
the 
disease 
as 
well 
as 
other 
who 
view 
cancer 
as 
a 
permanent 
feature 
of 
their 
life 
for 
the 
late 
group 
dominant 
notion 
of 
survival 
be 
incongruent 
with 
their 
belief 
that 
medicine 
guarantee 
the 
permanent 
removal 
of 
cancerous 
cell 
from 
the 
body 
thus 
they 
alter 
the 
meaning 
of 
survivorship 
to 
account 
for 
the 
possibility 
of 
recurrence 
next 
i 
turn 
to 
the 
woman 
who 
do 
not 
identify 
as 
survivor 
the 
fear 
of 
recurrence 
also 
weigh 
heavily 
on 
this 
woman 
however 
rather 
than 
accept 
the 
survivor 
title 
and 
modify 
it 
to 
fit 
their 
fear 
the 
woman 
below 
do 
not 
accept 
the 
survivor 
identity 
in 
addition 
i 
present 
datum 
for 
two 
additional 
reason 
for 
reject 
be 
sick 
enough 
and 
not 
want 
to 
be 
part 
of 
the 
survivor 
group 
self 
from 
survivorship 
rejecting 
due 
to 
the 
fear 
of 
struggle 
with 
my 
feeling 
about 
survivorship 
you 
know 
and 
that 
always 
a 
question 
i 
think 
with 
other 
woman 
speak 
to 
it 
like 
well 
wait 
a 
minute 
what 
i 
be 
do 
i 
have 
cancer 
have 
i 
have 
cancer 
am 
i 
survivor 
am 
i 
warrior 
what 
be 
i 
i 
have 
a 
really 
good 
answer 
for 
that 
technically 
the 
day 
diagnose 
you 
can 
call 
yourself 
a 
survivor 
it 
feel 
really 
somehow 
because 
i 
guess 
i 
still 
feel 
like 
in 
the 
battle 
sophia 
age 
year 
quote 
above 
be 
aware 
of 
the 
available 
cultural 
and 
definition 
however 
sophia 
be 
among 
the 
woman 
in 
this 
sample 
who 
do 
not 
identify 
as 
a 
survivor 
many 
of 
this 
woman 
believe 
the 
survivor 
identity 
be 
too 
incongruent 
with 
the 
uncertainty 
they 
feel 
whereas 
the 
first 
group 
of 
woman 
keep 
the 
survivor 
title 
but 
tailor 
its 
meaning 
to 
their 
view 
this 
woman 
not 
accept 
the 
identity 
for 
example 
kathleen 
age 
year 
poignantly 
describe 
how 
the 
possibility 
of 
recurrence 
make 
the 
term 
survivor 
like 
that 
term 
because 
i 
know 
if 
i 
have 
beat 
it 
not 
sure 
have 
i 
really 
survive 
what 
i 
survive 
for 
a 
whole 
few 
month 
i 
know 
i 
guess 
i 
think 
of 
it 
that 
way 
in 
a 
plane 
crash 
and 
you 
survive 
you 
survive 
the 
plane 
crash 
not 
gonna 
get 
back 
in 
the 
plane 
and 
crash 
again 
but 
i 
have 
cancer 
i 
make 
it 
through 
treatment 
it 
be 
go 
for 
now 
but 
that 
mean 
it 
not 
gonna 
come 
back 
because 
of 
the 
possibility 
that 
she 
crash 
again 
kathleen 
instead 
refer 
to 
herself 
as 
cancer 
free 
for 
now 
a 
phrase 
which 
well 
capture 
the 
tentative 
nature 
of 
her 
health 
ann 
age 
year 
also 
view 
cancer 
as 
linger 
when 
ask 
if 
she 
identify 
herself 
as 
a 
survivor 
ann 
reply 
no 
i 
like 
that 
word 
at 
all 
she 
explain 
mean 
never 
go 
to 
have 
a 
problem 
again 
and 
i 
think 
that 
not 
maybe 
practical 
i 
think 
survive 
cancer 
mean 
die 
at 
of 
something 
else 
ultimately 
ann 
choose 
to 
classify 
herself 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
reality 
of 
her 
experience 
she 
say 
i 
phrase 
it 
as 
i 
be 
treat 
for 
breast 
cancer 
i 
figure 
that 
really 
fact 
that 
what 
i 
know 
to 
be 
true 
in 
the 
quote 
below 
age 
year 
explain 
her 
reluctance 
to 
identify 
as 
a 
survivor 
by 
highlight 
the 
contrast 
between 
the 
exacting 
medicalized 
period 
of 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
and 
the 
uncertain 
vague 
period 
follow 
want 
to 
be 
positive 
at 
the 
end 
of 
this 
and 
say 
yes 
gonna 
beat 
it 
and 
gonna 
be 
a 
survivor 
for 
life 
but 
there 
be 
time 
that 
you 
just 
wonder 
you 
know 
i 
get 
online 
and 
check 
and 
there 
be 
not 
any 
conclusive 
evidence 
out 
there 
on 
what 
your 
risk 
be 
for 
recurrence 
and 
i 
want 
somebody 
to 
tell 
me 
you 
be 
a 
great 
candidate 
for 
not 
recur 
and 
nobody 
have 
tell 
me 
that 
look 
for 
that 
and 
my 
oncologist 
he 
like 
not 
go 
there 
with 
you 
you 
know 
there 
be 
so 
much 
definition 
to 
the 
cancer 
you 
know 
the 
cancer 
be 
this 
grade 
and 
it 
estrogen 
receptor 
positive 
and 
this 
age 
and 
all 
this 
factor 
and 
this 
be 
what 
we 
can 
do 
everything 
be 
so 
precise 
and 
now 
it 
like 
back 
to 
the 
unknown 
again 
like 
i 
be 
before 
and 
i 
like 
emphasis 
add 
sophia 
whose 
early 
quote 
express 
her 
difficulty 
with 
the 
term 
survivor 
explain 
how 
she 
see 
while 
technically 
i 
can 
call 
myself 
a 
survivor 
i 
kind 
of 
guess 
i 
think 
of 
myself 
as 
a 
warrior 
as 
a 
breast 
cancer 
warrior 
which 
symbolize 
that 
at 
some 
point 
have 
this 
but 
that 
i 
recognize 
that 
the 
struggle 
may 
be 
still 
it 
still 
ongoing 
to 
some 
you 
just 
know 
what 
come 
down 
the 
not 
close 
enough 
to 
death 
to 
be 
a 
survivor 
give 
the 
cultural 
fear 
associate 
with 
cancer 
and 
medicine 
inability 
to 
prevent 
breast 
cancer 
or 
cure 
metastatic 
breast 
cancer 
leopold 
and 
patterson 
it 
be 
not 
altogether 
surprising 
that 
woman 
face 
difficulty 
reconcile 
their 
fear 
of 
recurrence 
with 
the 
message 
that 
they 
have 
beat 
cancer 
much 
unexpected 
be 
that 
several 
of 
the 
woman 
in 
this 
sample 
reject 
survivorship 
because 
they 
believe 
they 
be 
not 
sick 
enough 
to 
be 
a 
survivor 
a 
respondent 
by 
the 
name 
of 
olivia 
explain 
i 
see 
me 
as 
be 
close 
to 
death 
you 
know 
so 
in 
term 
of 
go 
to 
the 
relay 
event 
they 
say 
a 
survivor 
i 
may 
look 
at 
it 
like 
this 
one 
lady 
say 
she 
a 
instead 
of 
a 
survivor 
i 
probably 
tend 
much 
to 
believe 
on 
that 
end 
like 
other 
woman 
olivia 
craft 
her 
own 
definition 
of 
survivorship 
but 
do 
so 
because 
she 
do 
not 
come 
close 
enough 
to 
die 
martha 
age 
year 
reject 
survivorship 
because 
to 
her 
being 
a 
survivor 
mean 
that 
they 
be 
just 
deathly 
ill 
and 
i 
feel 
like 
i 
be 
deathly 
ill 
but 
i 
would 
have 
be 
probably 
within 
six 
month 
however 
neither 
of 
this 
woman 
have 
an 
easy 
bout 
with 
cancer 
each 
undergo 
surgery 
chemotherapy 
and 
radiation 
women 
like 
olivia 
and 
martha 
suggest 
that 
the 
breast 
cancer 
culture 
have 
emphasize 
the 
heroic 
battle 
against 
cancer 
to 
an 
extent 
that 
have 
alienate 
some 
woman 
from 
the 
breast 
cancer 
culture 
rejecting 
the 
social 
identity 
of 
survivor 
the 
final 
group 
of 
woman 
explicitly 
refuse 
to 
be 
part 
of 
the 
social 
identity 
that 
be 
breast 
cancer 
individual 
face 
chronic 
stigmatize 
severe 
or 
debilitating 
illness 
risk 
be 
socially 
identify 
by 
their 
disease 
bury 
charmaz 
goffman 
and 
in 
response 
the 
ill 
person 
may 
work 
to 
define 
herself 
as 
much 
than 
just 
an 
illness 
charmaz 
and 
charmaz 
in 
the 
case 
of 
survivorship 
this 
desire 
to 
not 
be 
identify 
by 
one 
illness 
extend 
even 
when 
the 
identity 
have 
positive 
age 
year 
explain 
that 
she 
do 
not 
need 
those 
symbol 
around 
her 
to 
remind 
her 
of 
what 
she 
have 
be 
through 
she 
say 
she 
be 
not 
the 
kind 
of 
person 
to 
wear 
the 
of 
honor 
and 
she 
like 
to 
think 
of 
herself 
in 
much 
complex 
term 
age 
year 
describe 
how 
she 
sometimes 
hate 
to 
be 
remind 
of 
her 
cancer 
by 
the 
pink 
ribbon 
and 
license 
plate 
she 
see 
around 
her 
she 
perhaps 
well 
articulate 
the 
discomfort 
with 
the 
public 
nature 
of 
breast 
like 
be 
part 
of 
group 
you 
know 
what 
i 
mean 
like 
i 
like 
be 
part 
of 
i 
like 
be 
a 
part 
of 
a 
society 
i 
like 
be 
an 
individual 
so 
i 
like 
be 
link 
in 
with 
a 
label 
and 
that 
the 
uncomfortable 
piece 
to 
me 
i 
mind 
tell 
you 
that 
have 
breast 
cancer 
but 
i 
want 
to 
commit 
myself 
to 
march 
across 
the 
us 
and 
i 
want 
to 
commit 
myself 
to 
this 
cause 
you 
know 
what 
i 
mean 
a 
woman 
name 
joanna 
take 
the 
reluctance 
to 
identify 
as 
a 
survivor 
far 
refuse 
to 
be 
labeled 
and 
refuse 
to 
ignore 
large 
factor 
she 
believe 
cause 
just 
feel 
like 
i 
see 
myself 
as 
a 
survivor 
and 
i 
like 
to 
buy 
into 
it 
like 
when 
the 
come 
home 
from 
iraq 
and 
tell 
you 
can 
have 
this 
prosthesis 
and 
you 
mind 
not 
have 
an 
arm 
and 
a 
war 
now 
that 
who 
you 
be 
and 
i 
like 
the 
government 
or 
the 
medical 
establishment 
labeling 
me 
something 
interviewer 
and 
what 
do 
you 
think 
that 
label 
mean 
or 
imply 
cancer 
survivor 
be 
somebody 
who 
be 
screw 
by 
the 
government 
once 
again 
the 
reason 
we 
get 
cancer 
be 
due 
to 
pollution 
and 
lack 
of 
care 
of 
human 
being 
in 
our 
culture 
and 
cancer 
survivor 
just 
mean 
be 
convince 
to 
look 
at 
yourself 
as 
somebody 
who 
think 
of 
the 
reason 
but 
you 
survive 
you 
know 
anything 
about 
globally 
where 
this 
event 
stand 
you 
just 
survive 
and 
that 
your 
label 
joanna 
be 
the 
only 
woman 
in 
the 
sample 
to 
the 
cultural 
definition 
of 
survivor 
and 
consider 
how 
those 
definition 
preclude 
a 
consideration 
of 
structural 
factor 
joanna 
draw 
upon 
a 
tradition 
within 
her 
native 
american 
culture 
to 
craft 
her 
own 
conception 
of 
breast 
only 
get 
through 
this 
because 
part 
native 
american 
and 
i 
have 
certain 
thing 
to 
think 
about 
during 
such 
time 
like 
the 
sundance 
where 
you 
put 
in 
your 
chest 
and 
you 
pull 
them 
out 
to 
prove 
your 
love 
of 
your 
fellow 
man 
and 
to 
show 
you 
can 
suffer 
and 
love 
so 
i 
view 
it 
like 
it 
really 
come 
in 
for 
me 
because 
it 
give 
me 
a 
device 
a 
way 
to 
look 
at 
this 
that 
make 
me 
not 
a 
cancer 
victim 
or 
cancer 
survivor 
someone 
who 
go 
to 
a 
sundance 
and 
i 
live 
and 
stronger 
now 
as 
joanna 
so 
articulate 
the 
sundance 
represent 
the 
meaning 
she 
want 
to 
associate 
with 
breast 
of 
her 
chest 
suffer 
and 
the 
of 
her 
life 
survivor 
as 
a 
framework 
for 
a 
final 
group 
of 
woman 
survivorship 
be 
not 
a 
salient 
part 
of 
their 
cancer 
experience 
when 
ask 
if 
she 
consider 
herself 
a 
survivor 
age 
year 
reply 
you 
know 
never 
really 
think 
about 
it 
but 
i 
guess 
i 
be 
the 
woman 
for 
whom 
survivorship 
lack 
be 
all 
over 
the 
age 
of 
year 
for 
them 
survivorship 
be 
unavailable 
or 
undesirable 
instead 
they 
relied 
on 
the 
discourse 
of 
the 
aging 
body 
as 
martha 
age 
year 
explain 
i 
really 
by 
it 
or 
anything 
i 
mean 
after 
you 
live 
year 
you 
know 
bind 
to 
have 
something 
like 
that 
discussion 
this 
finding 
suggest 
that 
dominant 
representation 
of 
disease 
pose 
challenge 
for 
individual 
attempt 
to 
make 
sense 
of 
illness 
even 
when 
the 
disease 
meaning 
be 
positive 
or 
what 
frank 
refer 
to 
as 
good 
story 
be 
much 
desire 
than 
positive 
cheerful 
story 
for 
breast 
cancer 
a 
good 
story 
would 
acknowledge 
the 
role 
of 
cancer 
in 
woman 
life 
and 
their 
fear 
of 
recurrence 
such 
a 
framework 
would 
reduce 
the 
separation 
of 
the 
private 
and 
public 
experience 
of 
cancer 
and 
draw 
woman 
close 
to 
the 
body 
which 
accept 
the 
contingency 
of 
life 
exhibit 
suffer 
openly 
and 
can 
share 
with 
other 
in 
their 
pain 
such 
a 
framework 
would 
also 
entail 
a 
shift 
in 
terminology 
from 
survivor 
to 
live 
with 
cancer 
or 
with 
cancer 
there 
have 
be 
recent 
call 
to 
recognize 
cancer 
as 
a 
chronic 
disease 
such 
as 
the 
institute 
of 
medicine 
report 
from 
cancer 
patient 
to 
cancer 
survivor 
in 
transition 
which 
detail 
the 
need 
of 
cancer 
patient 
however 
the 
datum 
present 
here 
demonstrate 
that 
woman 
with 
breast 
cancer 
face 
a 
conflict 
between 
cultural 
definition 
of 
survivorship 
and 
their 
own 
ongoing 
battle 
with 
cancer 
a 
good 
cancer 
story 
would 
also 
acknowledge 
the 
variation 
in 
response 
to 
breast 
cancer 
women 
response 
to 
survivorship 
vary 
even 
among 
a 
relatively 
sample 
capture 
at 
similar 
point 
the 
diversity 
of 
woman 
response 
to 
survivorship 
present 
a 
challenge 
to 
clinician 
and 
other 
responsible 
for 
address 
the 
need 
of 
cancer 
patient 
clearly 
labeling 
woman 
as 
survivor 
will 
assist 
some 
in 
their 
adjustment 
and 
leave 
other 
feeling 
uncomfortable 
moreover 
this 
finding 
add 
to 
our 
understanding 
of 
the 
use 
of 
culture 
because 
this 
woman 
be 
in 
the 
process 
of 
retool 
their 
life 
the 
process 
of 
building 
meaning 
around 
illness 
be 
evident 
a 
set 
of 
cultural 
meaning 
be 
salient 
to 
them 
however 
meaning 
be 
not 
simply 
reject 
or 
accept 
rather 
individual 
work 
to 
modify 
cultural 
meaning 
to 
fit 
their 
life 
by 
craft 
meaning 
woman 
agency 
after 
a 
medical 
event 
that 
can 
be 
highly 
impersonal 
abstract 
and 
technical 
women 
meaning 
be 
important 
because 
framework 
attach 
to 
experience 
shape 
subsequent 
action 
as

this

our 
hypothesis 
be 
that

produce 
this

in 
response 
to 
the 
cancer

and 
that 
this 
cytokine 
then 
go

it

well 
document 
in 
the

that

property 
in 
summary 
we 
have 
show 
that 
osteoblast 
display 
an 
inflammatory 
response 
when 
expose

cytokine

can 
target 
osteoclast 
precursor 
and 
osteoclast 
to 
bring 
about

matrix 
destruction 
thus 
osteoblast 
contribute 
to 
the 
osteolytic 
phenotype 
both 
through 
suppression 
of

production 
of

genetic

the

argumentation 
rule 
for 
this 
task 
require 
examination 
of

of

for 
example 
if 
a 
patient 
have 
two 
second 
degree 
relative 
who 
be 
diagnose 
with 
breast 
cancer 
before 
the

proforma

structure 
allow 
for 
datum 
item 
with 
simple 
value 
e.g. 
integer 
real 
number 
or 
text 
string 
it 
also 
allow

whose

be 
set 
of 
simple

e.g. 
set

etc. 
however 
when 
we 
consider 
a 
patient 
relative 
it 
be 
natural 
to 
regard 
each 
relative 
as 
a 
complex 
entity 
that 
be 
to 
say 
an 
entity 
with 
property 
such 
as 
date 
of 
birth 
date 
of 
diagnosis 
if 
any 
and 
so 
on 
the

can 
be 
much 
easily 
calculate 
by 
evaluate 
a 
set 
of 
such 
entity 
to 
determine 
how 
many 
of 
them 
possess 
particular 
property 
because 
proforma 
lack 
facility 
to 
represent 
such 
set 
of 
entity 
the 
representation 
of 
the 
argumentation 
involve 
in 
genetic 
risk 
assessment 
be 
somewhat 
a 
similar 
problem 
arise 
when 
it 
be 
necessary 
to 
represent 
the 
lesion 
reveal 
during 
examination 
of 
the 
patient 
a 
lesion 
would 
naturally 
be 
represent 
as 
a 
complex 
entity 
and 
the 
patient 
might 
have 
a 
set 
of 
such 
lesion 
the 
resultant 
complexity 
of 
the 
proforma 
expression 
use 
to 
reason 
over 
collection 
of 
entity 
create 
difficulty 
when 
one 
attempt 
to 
verify 
that 
the 
implementation 
correctly 
implement 
the 
requirement 
of 
the 
system 
however 
there 
be 
no 
inherent 
reason 
why 
the 
proforma 
language 
not 
be 
extend 
to 
represent

of

and

that

the 
weakness

in

might 
therefore 
good 
be

sign 
that

in 
this

we 
will 
briefly 
describe 
the 
basic

concept 
for 
typical

this 
concept 
can 
also 
be 
find 
in

and 
and 
give 
a

xi 
yi 
i

where 
xi 
and 
yi 
svm 
find 
an

separate 
hyperplane 
with 
the 
maximum 
margin 
by 
solve 
the 
follow 
optimization 
problem 
it 
be 
know 
that 
to 
solve 
this 
quadratic 
optimization 
problem 
one 
must 
find 
the 
saddle 
point 
of 
the 
lagrange 
function 
where 
the 
i 
denote 
lagrange 
multipliers 
hence 
i 
the 
search 
for 
an 
optimal 
saddle 
point 
be 
necessary 
because 
the 
lp 
must 
be 
minimize 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
variable 
w 
and 
b 
and 
maximize 
with

to 
the

i 
by 
differentiate 
with 
respect 
to 
w

b 
and 
introduce 
the 
condition 
for 
the

constrain 
function 
then 
be 
transform 
to 
the 
dual 
lagrangian 
ld 
to 
find 
the

a

must 
be 
maximize 
with

to 
i 
the

i 
for 
the 
dual 
optimization 
problem 
determine 
the 
parameter 
w 
and 
b 
of 
the 
optimal 
hyperplane 
thus 
the 
optimal 
hyperplane 
decision 
function 
f 
x 
w 
x 
b 
can 
be 
write 
as 
in 
a

task 
only 
a 
small 
subset 
of 
the 
lagrange 
multipliers 
i 
usually 
tend 
to 
be 
great 
than 
zero 
this 
vector 
be 
the

depend 
on

exclusively 
the 
above 
concept 
can 
also 
be 
extend 
to 
the 
case 
linear 
generalized

of 
this

the 
problem 
of

use 
the

which 
be 
almost 
equivalent 
to

our

apply 
to

the

how

at

demonstrate 
you

be 
in

it 
bother 
me 
you 
know 
i 
think 
about 
it

worry 
about 
it 
or 
nothing 
like 
that 
but 
then 
when 
i 
start 
turn 
that 
when 
it 
start 
to 
much 
on 
my 
mind 
and 
i 
would 
sit 
and 
think 
and 
worry 
and 
then 
i 
let 
it 
go

once 
i 
start 
reach 
now 
this 
be 
when 
it 
be 
start 
to 
worry 
much 
now 
i 
have 
other 
thing 
on 
my

like 
i 
be 
much 
active 
like 
you 
be 
then

now 
as 
i 
be 
get 
old 
i 
understand 
much 
and 
i 
be

wise 
much 
and 
remember 
my 
mum 
at 
you 
see 
that 
what 
go 
through 
my 
mind 
i 
be 
next 
year 
and 
i 
have 
get 
this 
thing 
in 
my 
mind 
that 
i 
will 
get 
cancer 
i 
be 
convince 
that 
i 
will 
get 
it 
and 
that 
what 
frightening

the

be 
often 
the 
motivation 
for

this 
have

in

demonstrate 
however 
in 
the 
current

there 
be 
negative 
example 
of 
this

who 
describe

even 
when 
they 
be

if

the

think 
about

then 
no

be 
describe 
the 
reason 
why 
this

do 
not 
have

be 
likely 
due 
to 
other 
contextual 
factor 
the

map 
help 
highlight 
this

by 
highlight

such 
as 
care 
for

therefore 
not

also 
the 
ability 
to 
chart 
the

onto

own

be 
a

it 
be 
perhaps 
important 
to

with 
individual 
at

from 
chronic

due 
to 
their

our 
study 
concur 
with 
many 
of 
the 
finding 
from 
this

the

both 
the

element 
in

the

sense 
model 
of

which 
arise 
from 
the

conclusion 
two 
question 
lie 
at 
the 
of 
much 
traditional 
social 
science 
life 
course 
research 
how 
have 
individual 
be 
affect 
by 
social 
change 
and 
how 
have 
the 
life 
course 
situation 
of 
some 
group 
actually 
influence 
social 
change 
the 
purpose 
of 
this 
article 
have 
be 
to 
highlight 
the 
value 
that 
life 
course 
research 
methodology 
bring 
to 
nursing 
research 
possible 
question 
to 
consider 
be 
how 
have 
patient 
be 
affect 
by 
our 
healthcare 
system 
and 
how 
have 
the 
life 
course 
situation 
of 
certain 
patient 
influence 
healthcare 
change 
this 
article 
have 
show 
that 
the 
life 
course 
paradigm 
allow 
a 
broad 
understanding 
of 
health 
behaviour 
by 
place 
behaviour 
in 
its 
social 
and 
political 
context 
and 
also 
the 
focus 
from 
purely 
psychological 
determinant 
to 
include 
a 
temporal 
element 
as 
well 
as 
environmental 
economic 
social 
and 
behavioural 
determinant 
of 
chronic 
disease 
the 
life 
chart 
use 
in 
this 
study 
be 
draw 
by 
a 
computer 
package 
however 
it 
be 
possible 
to 
discuss 
and 
draw 
an 
individual 
life 
chart 
with 
and 
paper 
it 
would 
be 
interesting 
to 
develop 
the 
technique 
far 
with 
the 
option 
of 
much 
dynamic 
life 
charting 
at 
the 
time 
of 
interview 
we 
conclude 
that 
the 
novel 
method 
of 
life 
course 
chart 
help 
to 
highlight 
similarity 
and 
difference 
relate 
to 
a

this 
a 
valuable

for

the

the

the

be 
non 
significant 
the 
protective 
effect 
of 
low 
and 
regular 
wine 
consumption 
on 
breast 
cancer 
be 
plausible 
since 
wine 
particularly 
red 
wine 
contain 
high 
level 
of 
antioxidant 
as 
well 
as 
resveratrol 
a 
phytoestrogen 
with 
anticancer 
property 
and 
it 
be 
also 
likely 
that 
high 
regular 
level 
of 
alcohol

the 
beneficial 
effect 
this 
last 
hypothesis 
can 
explain 
previous 
result 
concern 
the 
deleterious 
effect 
of 
moderate 
to 
high 
wine 
consumption 
on 
breast 
cancer 
however 
our 
study 
not 
confirm 
this 
hypothesis 
because 
only 
for 
case 
and 
for 
control 
of 
the 
study 
population 
consume 
much 
than 
two 
drink 
of 
wine 
per 
day 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
our 
study 
may 
explain 
the 
protective 
effect 
of 
alcohol 
consumption 
find 
since 
wine 
be 
the 
predominant 
type 
of 
alcoholic 
beverage

decrease 
when

in 
contrast 
the 
risk 
associate 
with 
frequent 
drinker 
do 
not 
differ 
from 
those 
of 
nondrinker 
result 
of 
some 
study 
suggest 
that 
the 
association 
between 
alcohol

can 
be 
modify 
by 
use 
of 
hrt 
and 
whereas 
finding 
from 
other 
study 
support 
no 
difference 
between 
hrt 
user 
and 
and 
in 
the 
present 
study 
the 
estimate 
association 
with 
average 
alcohol

be 
identical 
for 
both 
hrt 
and

the 
association 
between 
drinking 
pattern 
and 
breast 
cancer 
risk 
do 
not 
differ 
within 
either 
of 
this 
group 
of 
hrt 
user 
although 
we 
find 
hrt 
to 
have 
no 
significance 
on 
alcohol 
 
breast 
cancer 
association 
we 
exclude 
a 
possible 
effect 
in 
fact 
take 
separately 
factor 
may 
register 
an 
association 
however 
this 
may 
not 
necessarily 
be 
the 
case 
when 
consider 
together 
the 
effect 
of 
alcohol 
on 
various 
biological 
mechanism 
in 
the 
of 
breast 
cancer 
have 
be 
widely 
discuss 
investigator 
have 
suggest 
that 
alcohol 
consumption 
increase 
the 
risk 
of 
breast 
cancer 
among 
woman 
by 
influence 
estrogen 
metabolism 
the 
promotion 
of 
the 
growth 
of 
breast 
cancer 
may 
also 
be 
explain 
by 
an 
increase 
production 
by 
the 
liver 
of 
an 
growth 
factor 
associate 
with 
moderate 
alcohol 
intake 
likewise 
alcohol 
may 
exhibit 
mutagenic 
and 
oxidative 
effect 
in 
breast 
tissue 
affect 
folate 
level 
and 
lead 
to 
damage 
dna 
although 
several 
possible 
mechanism 
link 
chronic 
alcohol 
consumption 
to 
breast 
cancer 
it 
be 
possible 
that 
the 
critical 
effect 
of 
alcohol 
on 
cancer 
depend 
on 
a 
threshold 
value 
the 
absence 
of 
adverse 
effect 
of 
low 
alcohol 
consumption 
on 
cancer 
find 
in 
our 
study 
be 
therefore 
plausible 
the 
strength 
of 
this 
study 
be 
its 
ability 
to 
examine 
the 
association 
between 
breast 
cancer 
and 
drinking 
pattern 
of

beverage 
particularly

furthermore 
several

factor 
and 
total 
duration 
of

educational 
level 
in 
our 
study 
be

it 
represent 
an 
indicator 
of 
the

study 
some

have 
observe 
that 
a

but 
none 
have 
report 
a 
significant 
interaction 
to 
avoid 
a 
possible 
confound 
effect 
between 
alcohol 
and 
breast 
cancer 
due 
to 
socioeconomic 
status 
all 
analysis 
be 
adjust 
for 
educational 
level 
because 
frequent 
and 
moderate 
to 
heavy 
consumption 
of 
alcohol 
be 
rare 
in 
our 
population 
we 
do 
not 
have 
adequate 
statistical 
power 
to 
examine 
the 
relationship 
between

and 
breast

although 
case 
and 
control 
be 
interview 
in 
similar 
condition 
we 
not 
avoid 
a 
possible 
recall 
bias 
inherent 
in 
retrospective 
study 
we 
can 
attribute 
the 
unexpected 
finding 
of 
the 
protective 
effect 
of 
alcohol 
consumption 
to 
possible 
recall 
bias 
since

however 
although

in 
the 
mediterranean 
region 
be 
common 
discuss 
alcohol 
consumption 
remain 
among

lead 
to 
minimize 
the

the

alcohol

be 
not 
possible 
in 
our

that

that

by

with

the 
second 
hypothesis 
that 
the

be 
expose 
to 
high 
hormone 
level 
typical 
of

then 
do

some

the

any

the

also 
become

many

also 
opt

for 
psychosocial 
reason 
thus 
the 
use 
of 
pmrt 
in 
the 
setting 
of

have 
become 
much 
prevalent 
and 
the 
ability

there

a

the 
two 
general 
category 
of 
reconstructive 
technique 
be 
autologous

autologous 
reconstruction 
much

the

a 
long

period 
some 
patient 
be 
not 
able 
to 
undergo 
this 
type 
of 
reconstruction 
because 
of 
comorbid

also 
thin 
woman 
may 
not 
have 
enough

therefore 
many 
woman 
be

disadvantage

first 
the

second 
both

autologous

technique 
prolong

therefore 
increase 
the 
risk 
of

however 
many 
woman 
prefer 
not 
to

for 
psychosocial 
reason 
reconstruction 
also

furthermore 
tissue

a 
downside 
of

the

the

involve

rather 
than 
a

although 
irradiation 
of 
the

be 
feasible 
it 
be 
not 
ideal 
because 
the 
magnetic 
component 
of 
the

interfere 
with

the 
other 
potential 
problem 
with 
this 
approach 
be 
the 
fact 
that 
tissue 
expansion 
after

be 
with 
complication 
the 
formation 
of 
an 
expander 
capsule 
after

before

may 
allow

the

on 
this 
be 
also 
limited 
one 
potential 
advantage 
of 
the 
algorithm 
in 
patient 
who 
receive 
adjuvant

be 
that 
it 
likely 
result 
in 
a 
short

an 
alternative

to

that 
also 
address 
the 
concern

the 
integration 
of 
pmrt 
into 
the 
reconstructive 
algorithm 
use

autologous

this

we

it

the

the

individually 
be 
not

however 
only 
three

the

individually 
with 
the

in 
one 
of 
this

the

as

in 
addition 
er 
and 
pr

be 
report 
as 
either 
positive 
or 
negative 
rather 
than 
as 
grade

which 
for 
statistical 
reason 
have 
reduce 
the 
chance 
for 
find 
a 
significant

association 
between 
pr

and 
perhaps 
er

with 
the 
stage 
of 
breast 
cancer 
at

adequate 
testing 
of 
this 
relationship 
by 
this 
study 
be 
far 
jeopardize 
because 
they 
do 
not 
account 
for 
the

and 
histological

thus 
since

property 
the 
finding 
in 
this

indicate 
that 
pr 
in 
the

may 
play 
a 
significant 
role 
by 
block 
tumor 
invasion 
and

in 
another 
study 
it 
be 
find 
that

substantially 
inhibit

growth 
in 
scid 
mouse

in 
the

progesterone

find 
to 
induce 
cellular 
differentiation 
of 
breast 
cancer 
cell 
transfected 
with 
pr

in 
the 
much 
recent 
study 
it 
be 
demonstrate 
that 
progesterone 
treatment 
of 
breast

result 
in 
a 
whole 
genome

that 
have 
strong 
antiproliferative 
and 
antineoplastic 
feature 
thus 
the 
finding 
in 
this 
study 
overall 
suggest 
that 
progesterone 
act 
through 
pr

play 
a 
role 
in

furthermore 
because 
this 
study 
indicate 
that 
pr 
may 
be 
a 
therapeutic 
target 
in 
breast 
cancer 
this 
lend 
support 
to 
conduct 
future 
in

study 
to 
determine 
the 
threshold 
level 
of 
pr 
expression 
that 
be 
necessary 
to 
induce 
favorable 
tumor 
effect 
there 
be 
also 
some 
evidence 
to 
suggest 
that 
pr 
may 
serve 
a 
protective 
role 
in 
breast 
cancer 
progression 
via 
mechanism 
in 
recent 
study 
it 
be 
observe 
that 
knockdown 
of 
pr 
in 
breast 
cancer 
cell 
cause 
activation 
of

a 
fold 
induction 
of

this 
be 
observe 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
exogenous 
progesterone 
suggest 
that 
pr 
exert 
a 
action 
to 
inhibit 
activation 
which 
be 
induce 
by 
proinflammatory 
cytokine 
growth 
factor 
and 
tumor 
promoter 
be 
link 
to 
carcinogenesis 
and 
have 
be 
find 
to 
be 
overexpressed 
in 
a 
significant 
portion 
of 
breast 
cancer 
particularly 
in 
those 
that 
express 
 
neu 
in 
addition 
transcription 
factor 
which 
mediate 
the 
action 
of 
proinflammatory 
cytokine 
to

appear 
to 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
breast 
carcinogenesis 
moreover 
selective 
ablation 
of 
pr 
in 
cell 
in 
condition 
also 
lead 
to 
increase 
in 
the 
expression 
of 
the 
cytoskeletal 
protein 
which 
be 
highly 
correlated 
with 
tumor 
cell 
invasiveness 
and 
metastasis 
it 
be 
far 
demonstrate 
that

the

of 
pr 
in 
the 
absence

it 
have 
also

note 
that

receptor 
with 
pr 
mediate 
focal 
adhesion 
of 
breast 
cancer 
cell 
transfected 
with 
pr 
cdna 
which 
would 
reduce 
the 
potential 
for 
tumor 
metastasis 
thus 
this 
protective 
action 
of 
pr 
may 
be 
of 
great 
significance 
in 
the 
case 
of 
postmenopausal 
woman 
where 
circulate 
level 
of 
progesterone 
be 
absent 
or 
negligible 
a 
possible 
limitation 
of 
this 
study 
be 
that 
we 
do 
not 
account 
for 
all 
of 
the

or 
important

in 
the

that

however 
we 
do 
account 
for 
the 
much 
important 
confounder 
based 
on 
a 
thorough 
literature 
review 
we 
be 
also 
aware 
that 
although 
the 
result 
of 
this 
study 
indicate 
that 
pr

be 
an 
important 
marker 
of 
early 
stage 
breast 
cancer 
one 
conclude 
from 
this 
result 
that 
pr 
decrease 
breast 
cancer 
progression 
however 
our 
finding 
that 
pr 
expression 
be 
significantly 
and 
inversely 
associate 
with 
the 
stage 
of 
breast 
cancer 
at 
diagnosis 
a 
strong 
predictor 
of 
breast 
cancer 
prognosis 
also 
suggest 
that 
if 
pr 
be 
activate 
or 
reactivate 
that 
it 
may 
be 
of 
therapeutic 
benefit 
in 
light 
of 
the 
potential 
protective 
role 
of 
pr 
in 
breast

as 
indicate 
in 
the 
mechanistic 
study 
mention 
above 
in 
conclusion 
the 
study 
provide 
new 
information 
indicate 
that 
pr 
and 
not 
er 
expression 
be 
a 
marker 
for 
early 
stage 
breast 
cancer 
indicate 
that 
pr 
expression 
be 
an 
important 
prognostic 
marker 
for 
breast 
cancer 
that 
will 
likely 
enhance 
our 
ability 
to 
effectively 
treat 
select 
patient 
in 
addition 
based 
on 
current 
experimental 
research 
indicate 
that 
pr 
may 
play 
a 
role 
in 
reduce 
the 
progression 
of 
breast 
cancer 
pr 
be 
also 
a 
potential 
target 
for 
therapy 
in 
breast

thus 
our 
finding 
emphasize 
the 
importance 
of 
conduct 
future 
study 
to 
further 
test 
the 
importance 
of 
pr 
as 
a

in

as 
well 
as 
to 
determine 
whether

however 
there 
be 
some 
report 
that

explanation 
for 
this

result 
be 
that 
both 
barrier 
and 
transport 
component 
of 
the

can 
be 
attributed

committed

progenitors 
as

for

a 
central 
question 
in 
cancer 
biology 
be 
the 
cellular 
origin 
of 
cancer 
do 
cancer 
originate 
from 
normal 
stem 
cell 
that 
lose 
normal 
growth 
control 
or 
do 
they 
initiate 
from

or 
much

of

through

s 
current 
view 
be 
derived 
largely 
from 
study 
of 
leukemia 
in 
the 
hematopoietic 
system 
since 
hematopoietic 
stem 
cell 
hscs 
be 
endow 
with 
it 
have 
be 
argue 
that 
transformation 
of 
hscs 
provide 
a 
simple 
mean 
to 
generate 
leukemic 
cell 
cellular 
phenotype 
in 
diverse 
leukemia 
mirror 
those 
of 
progenitor 
rather 
than 
hscs 
in 
fact 
evidence 
in 
both 
patient 
and 
mouse 
model 
favor 
a 
progenitor 
cell 
origin 
for 
many 
leukemia 
e.g. 
see 
et 
al. 
and 
et 
al. 
similarly 
although 
mascs 
be 
often 
propose 
as 
cell 
of 
origin 
for 
breast 
tumor 
cellular 
phenotype 
of 
human 
breast 
cancer 
be 
not 
easily 
reconcile 
with 
this 
view 
for 
instance 
since 
mascs 
can 
give 
rise 
to 
both 
luminal

myoepithelial 
cell 
one 
would 
expect 
to 
see 
mix 
cell 
type 
in

if 
mascs 
represent 
the 
predominant 
cellular 
origin 
yet 
much 
human 
breast 
tumor 
exhibit

of 
luminal

this 
suggest 
that 
much 
differentiate 
cell 
in 
mg 
may 
serve 
as 
cell 
of

for

however 
the 
existence 
of

the 
cellular 
origin 
of

difficult

therefore 
represent 
a 
alternative

previous

moreover

discussion

the 
result 
of 
this

suggest 
that 
the 
degree 
of 
emotional 
impact 
on 
both 
breast 
cancer 
physician 
and 
patient 
at 
the 
time 
of 
first 
recurrence 
be 
great 
than 
at 
first 
diagnosis 
our 
result 
suggest 
that 
this 
be 
due 
to 
both 
the 
emotional 
impact 
of 
recurrence 
itself 
as 
well 
as 
the 
dilemma 
physician 
face 
regard 
how 
to 
choose 
the 
much 
appropriate 
treatment 
for 
patient

breast 
cancer 
that 
level 
of 
distress 
be 
great 
for 
both 
party 
at 
this 
stage 
be 
perhaps 
because 
for 
patient 
in 
this 
situation 
our 
survey 
suggest 
that 
recurrence 
mean 
death 
while 
for 
physician 
recurrence 
imply 
failure 
on 
both 
side 
question 
be 
likely 
to 
be 
raise 
about 
the 
adequacy 
and 
efficacy 
of 
previous

and 
confidence 
in 
the 
physician 
and 
future 
therapy 
may 
be 
reduce 
in 
line 
with 
previous 
report 
the 
result 
of 
this 
survey 
highlight 
that 
the 
treatment 
goal 
for 
the 
physician 
treat 
patient 
with 
advance

cancer 
be 
to 
improve 
quality 
of 
life 
while 
extend 
overall 
this 
point 
along 
with 
those 
raise 
above 
suggest 
that 
great 
effort 
should 
be 
make 
to 
research 
treatment 
option 
for 
patient 
with 
advance 
breast 
cancer 
and 
that 
the 
result 
of 
such 
trial 
should 
be 
disseminate 
effectively 
perhaps 
through 
the 
use 
of 
guideline 
in 
addition 
the 
use 
of 
new 
technology 
such 
as 
interactive 
computer 
program 
and

may 
help

that

the 
optimum 
treatment 
strategy 
for

this 
survey 
show 
that 
treatment 
guideline 
be 
a 
key 
source 
of 
information 
support 
the 
treatment 
decision 
make

patient 
with

ranking 
alongside

the

approximately 
half 
of 
the

respondent 
also 
list 
patient

this 
may 
in 
part 
reflect 
the 
fact 
that 
patient 
with 
breast 
cancer 
be 
often 
very 
well 
inform 
of 
the 
available 
treatment 
option 
and 
thus 
may 
have 
great 
involvement 
in 
the

the 
fact 
that

may 
also

respondents 
in

due 
to 
the

associate 
with 
at

california 
environmental

agency 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
risk 
associate 
with 
active

be 
not 
much 
large 
than 
the 
risk 
associate 
with 
passive

despite 
the 
much 
large 
dose 
of 
smoke 
that 
smoker 
receive 
also 
concern 
some 
researcher 
the 
available 
evidence 
indicate 
that 
like 
heart 
disease 
the 
dose 
response 
curve 
be 
not 
linear 
there 
be 
several 
possible 
explanation 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
risk 
of 
active 
and 
passive

be 
not 
much 
different 
morabia 
et 
al. 
california 
environmental

agency 
and 
johnson 
none 
of 
which 
be 
consider 
definitively 
establish 
one 
explanation 
be 
that 
active 
smoking 
damage 
ovary 
and 
depress 
estrogen 
level 
which 
be 
associate 
with 
low 
breast 
cancer 
risk 
this 
effect 
would 
tend 
to 
counter 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
carcinogen 
in 
the 
smoke 
in 
active 
smoker 
much 
than 
passive 
smoker 
who 
do 
not 
receive 
a 
large 
enough 
dose 
of 
smoke 
to 
depress 
estrogen 
level 
another 
explanation 
be 
relate 
to 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
woman 
who 
be 
genetically 
susceptible 
to 
cancer 
develop 
them 
at 
a 
young 
age 
the 
biological 
mechanism 
that 
give 
rise 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
linear 
dose 
response 
curve 
between 
active 
and 
passive 
smoking 
be 
clearly 
an 
important 
area 
for 
far 
basic 
research 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
biology 
be 
not 
completely 
work 
out 
however 
have 
never 
be 
require 
before 
as 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
the 
identification 
of 
a 
risk 
for 
example 
it 
take 
over 
a 
decade 
between 
when 
the 
increase 
risk 
for 
heart 
disease 
from 
passive 
smoking 
be 
first 
identify 
see 
for 
example 
glantz 
and 
and 
when 
there 
be 
a 
reasonably 
complete 
understanding 
of 
the 
biology 
to 
explain 
why 
the 
effect 
of 
active 
and 
passive 
smoking 
be 
so 
similar 
see 
for 
example 
and 
glantz 
indeed 
even 
though 
the 
tobacco 
industry 
have 
routinely 
demand 
detail 
biological 
explanation 
before 
determine 
causality 
ever 
since 
the 
original

report 
u.s.

that

in 
neither

that 
every

the 
aim 
of 
this 
study 
be 
the 
chemical 
modification 
of 
the 
antimitotic 
to 
derivative 
with 
in 
vivo 
activity 
since 
the 
only 
reactive 
group 
in 
be 
the 
aldehyde 
function 
its 
conversion 
to 
a 
methylene 
propanedinitrile 
structure 
should 
render 
the 
molecule 
stable 
to 
metabolic 
transformation 
that 
reduce 
the 
bioactivity 
of 
the 
parent 
structure 
the 
result 
of 
this 
study 
show 
that 
the 
carbonyl 
oxygen 
in 
the 
can 
be 
replace 
by 
the 
group 
without 
abolish 
the 
activity 
on 
cancer 
cell 
it 
be 
also 
interesting 
to 
note 
that 
the 
different 
substituents 
in 
the 
methylene 
propanedinitrile 
have 
a 
similar 
influence 
on 
the 
antitumor 
activity 
as 
in 
the 
aldehyde 
series 
the 
similarity 
of 
the 
structure 
activity 
relationship 
indicate 
a 
common 
mode 
of 
action 
for 
both 
aldehyde 
and 
the 
corresponding 
methylene 
propanedinitrile 
but 
when 
we 
investigate 
the 
mode 
of 
action 
of 
the 
methylene 
we 
find 
that 
they 
must 
act 
through 
a 
different 
mechanism 
the 
aldehyde 
be 
show 
to 
inhibit 
tubulin 
polymerization 
and 
this 
action 
be 
assume 
to 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
strong 
antimitotic 
effect 
of 
the 
aldehyde 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
propanedinitrile 
and 
aldehyde 
share 
the 
same 
structure 
activity 
profile 
and 
the 
significantly 
high 
activity 
of 
much 
the 
aldehyde 
can 
be 
rationalized 
by 
a 
common 
mode 
of 
action 
for 
both 
type 
of 
indole 
derivative 
but 
must 
encompass 
an 
additional 
effect 
of 
the 
aldehyde 
on 
tubulin 
polymerization 
this 
assumption 
be 
support 
by 
the 
datum 
for 
the 
unsubstituted 
aldehyde 
and 
its 
methoxy 
derivative 
both 
show 
similar 
cytostatic 
activity 
but 
only 
inhibit 
tubulin 
polymerization 
obviously 
the 
methoxy 
group 
in 
of 
the 
phenyl 
ring 
play 
a 
crucial 
role 
in 
the 
interaction 
with 
tubulin 
when 
the 
methoxy 
group 
be 
locate 
in 
the 
position 
of 
the 
indole 
rather 
than 
in 
of 
the 
phenyl 
ring 
no 
inhibition 
of 
tubulin 
polymerization 
be 
the 
precise 
mechanism 
by 
which 
the 
methylene 
propanedinitrile 
inhibit 
cell 
growth 
remain 
unclear 
this 
agent 
block 
the 
cell 
cycle 
in 
 
m 
phase 
and 
drive 
the 
cell 
into 
an 
apoptotic 
cell 
death 
this 
process 
be 
probably 
mediate 
by 
the 
activation 
of 
caspase 
such 
as 
caspase 
and 
both 
enzyme 
activity 
be 
strongly 
stimulate 
at 
concentration 
to 
fold 
high 
than 
and 
much 
low 
than 
those 
require 
for 
the 
anticancer 
drug 
etoposide 
this 
finding 
be 
in 
accord 
with 
the 
observe 
fragmentation 
of 
nuclear 
dna 
at 
concentration 
from 
the 
datum 
obtain 
the 
growth 
inhibitory 
effect 
of 
the 
indole 
can 
be 
rationalized

the 
result 
of 
an 
apoptotic 
cell 
death 
follow 
the 
cell 
cycle 
arrest

however 
the 
reason 
for 
the

an

exclude 
another

ptk 
because 
the

many

the

be

the

this 
be 
illustrate 
by 
an 
interview 
study 
that 
show 
that 
all 
adolescent 
respondent 
regardless 
of 
age 
respond 
affirmatively 
when 
ask 
whether 
they 
would 
undergo

the

status

significantly 
little 
support 
for

than 
do 
a 
survey 
study 
of 
unaffected 
relative 
of

cancer 
patient 
a 
potential 
explanation 
for 
this 
find 
be 
that 
individual 
who 
have 
experience 
genetic 
counselling 
and 
testing 
themselves 
may 
be 
much 
aware 
of 
the 
potential

limitation 
than 
those 
who 
have 
not

this 
might 
also 
explain 
why 
relatively 
many 
respondent 
support 
genetic 
testing 
in

for 
an 
condition 
such 
as

they

for

to

for

herself 
this 
cautious 
position 
towards

because

the

hour 
women 
be 
interview 
prior 
to

about 
their

e.g. 
what 
do 
you 
understand 
by 
the 
term 
chemotherapy 
how 
do 
you 
feel 
about 
have 
and 
about 
how 
they 
think 
this 
might 
impact 
on 
appearance 
e.g. 
do 
you 
anticipate 
that 
the 
chemotherapy 
will 
change 
your 
physical 
appearance 
or 
your 
feeling 
about 
your

seldom

of 
thematic

that 
across 
a

have 
much 
in 
common 
with 
other 
form 
of

such 
as

ground 
theory 
which 
search 
for 
pattern

across 
a

but 
be 
not

a

which

that 
it 
can

see 
braun 
and 
clarke 
for 
an

discussion 
of 
thematic 
analysis 
in 
the 
current 
study 
thematic 
analysis 
be 
use 
to 
identify 
recurrent 
pattern 
in 
woman 
experience 
of 
prepare 
for 
the 
side 
effect 
of 
chemotherapy 
treatment 
the 
analysis 
proceed 
through 
a 
number 
of 
stage 
firstly 
the 
datum 
be 
transcribe 
and 
two 
researcher 
read 
and 
the 
transcript 
and 
note 
initial 
observation 
secondly 
this 
initial 
observation 
be 
review 
to 
develop 
initial 
code 
which 
be 
then 
systematically 
apply 
to 
the 
datum 
set 
to 
identify 
all 
datum 
extract 
associate 
with 
this 
code 
this 
code 
be 
review 
for 
consistency 
with 
the 
datum 
extract 
i.e. 
be 
all 
the 
datum 
extract 
coherent 
and 
relate 
and 
do 
they 
collectively 
represent 
the 
theme 
and 
for 
validity 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
whole 
datum 
set 
i.e. 
do 
the 
theme 
identify 
accurately 
represent 
the 
datum 
as 
a 
whole 
finally 
the 
theme 
be 
give 
a 
final 
definition 
and 
a 
name 
that 
reflect 
its 
content 
three 
key 
theme 
be 
identify 
and 
this 
be 
discuss 
below 
result 
and 
discussion 
for 
many 
of 
the 
woman 
in 
this 
study 
like 
those 
in 
other 
study 
chemotherapy 
be 
often 
see 
as 
synonymous 
with 
hair 
loss 
many 
woman 
find 
the 
thought 
of 
hair 
loss 
distressing 
but 
even 
those 
who 
seem 
little 
distressed 
or 
anxious 
about 
lose 
their 
hair 
still 
put 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
think 
into 
anticipate 
how 
they 
would 
manage 
and 
cope 
with 
hair 
loss 
the 
analysis 
reveal 
three 
key 
theme 
come 
to 
term 
with 
hair 
loss 
become 
ready 
and 
take 
control 
each 
of 
this 
theme 
be 
discuss 
in 
turn 
hair 
loss 
this 
woman 
like 
those 
in 
other 
qualitative 
study 
report 
that 
one 
of 
their 
first 
reaction 
to 
be 
tell 
that 
they 
will 
need 
chemotherapy 
be 
distress 
and 
anxiety 
about 
lose 
their 
hair 
many 
say 
this 
be 
the 
bad 
thing 
about 
the 
treatment 
and 
something 
that 
they 
be 
i 
just 
sort 
of 
sit 
there 
absolutely 
to 
think 
that 
i 
have 
to 
have 
chemo 
and 
initially 
and 
i 
will 
be 
with 
you 
my 
first 
think 
be 
oh 
my 
god 
go 
to 
lose 
my 
hair 
i 
think 
about 
anything 
else 
i 
think 
about 
be 
sick 
i 
think 
about 
anything 
else 
my 
god 
go 
to 
lose 
my 
hair 
many 
be 
concern 
that 
they 
would 
feel 
or 
not 
like 
their 
usual 
self 
see 
also 
gallagher 
this 
be 
particularly 
true 
for 
woman 
who 
consider 
their 
hair 
to 
be 
a 
special 
feature 
for 
example 
woman 
describe 
their 
hair 
as 
a 
security 
to 
hide 
behind 
as 
the 
one 
thing 
which 
they 
easily 
change 
to 
enhance 
their 
appearance 
as 
something 
they 
would 
spend 
a 
lot 
of 
money 
on 
and 
as 
something 
which 
make 
them 
different 
from 
other 
woman 
some 
be 
upset 
that 
other 
do 
not 
understand 
their 
distress 
and 
think 
that 
they 
be 
many 
be 
also 
concern 
that 
their 
hair 
loss 
would 
make 
them 
identifiable 
as 
a 
and 
that 
they 
would 
subsequently 
lose 
their 
privacy 
see 
also 
and 
in 
press 
and 
rosman 
however 
like 
rosman 
we 
find 
that 
not 
all 
woman 
react 
in 
this 
accept 
hair 
loss 
as 
an 
inevitable 
consequence 
of 
treatment 
and 
even 
welcome 
the 
opportunity 
to 
their 
image 
through 
wig 
and 
short 
this 
reaction 
be 
consider 
a 
form 
of 
affective 
rehearsal 
which 
gallagher 
describe 
the 
process 
of 
woman 
predict 
based 
on 
personal 
experience 
her 
response 
to 
cancer 
and 
the 
meaning 
she 
assign 
to 
her 
hair 
the 
intensity 
of 
distress 
her 
hair 
loss 
will 
create 
women 
anticipate 
hair 
loss 
they 
try 
out 
different 
emotional 
reaction 
and 
test 
the 
opinion 
of 
other 
in 
advance 
of 
actual 
hair 
loss 
to 
term 
with 
the 
inevitability 
of 
hair 
loss 
this 
theme 
describe 
the 
process 
of 
come 
to 
accept 
that 
hair 
loss 
be 
likely 
or 
inevitable 
and 
let 
go 
of 
the 
often 
unrealistic 
hope 
that 
hair 
might 
be 
retain 
fear 
of 
hair 
loss 
mean 
some 
woman 
be 
initially 
to 
engage 
with 
the 
treatment 
i 
want 
to 
have 
it 
chemotherapy 
want 
to 
lose 
my 
hair 
do 
i 
other 
hope 
that 
they 
would 
be 
one 
of 
the 
lucky 
few 
who 
will 
avoid 
hair 
loss 
at 
the 
back 
of 
your 
mind 
hope 
be 
the 
one 
person 
it 
happen 
to 
medical 
research 
allow 
healthcare 
professional 
to 
predict 
with 
a 
fair 
amount 
of 
certainty 
which 
drug 
and 
treatment 
regimen 
produce 
the 
great 
likelihood 
of 
hair 
loss 
and 
when 
this 
loss 
will 
occur 
women 
uncertainty 
and 
the 
between 
fear 
and 
hope 
end 
when 
this 
new 
be 
deliver 
for 
example 
one 
woman 
describe 
how 
friend 
have 
try 
to 
comfort 
her 
with 
story 
about 
other 
who 
have 
undergo 
chemotherapy 
but 
have 
not 
experience 
hair 
loss 
but 
then 
her 
consultant 
tell 
her 
that 
she 
would 
definitely 
lose 
her 
own 
hair 
he 
actually 
sit 
down 
in 
front 
of 
me 
and 
say 
name 
go 
to 
lose 
your 
hair 
then 
i 
come 
to 
term 
with 
it 
a 
bit 
much 
i 
think 
i 
almost 
have 
this 
think 
in 
my 
head 
well 
maybe 
i 
not 
do 
perhaps 
i 
might 
be 
lucky 
perhaps 
it 
might 
only 
go 
thin 
but 
when 
he 
actually 
look 
at 
me 
and 
he 
say 
go 
to 
lose 
your 
hair 
you 
might 
keep 
your 
but 
go 
to 
lose 
your 
hair 
then 
i 
start 
to 
come 
to 
term 
with 
it 
because 
i 
think 
now 
i 
can 
take 
step 
to 
be 
positive 
and 
do 
something 
about 
it 
although 
often 
see 
as 
upset 
new 
this 
nevertheless 
allow 
woman 
to 
accept 
that 
they 
will 
lose 
their 
hair 
and 
to 
start 
focusing 
on 
how 
to 
prepare 
manage 
and 
cope 
with 
this 
event 
becoming 
ready 
this 
theme 
describe 
the 
time 
energy 
and 
emotional 
resource 
which 
woman 
invest 
in 
explore 
how 
to 
manage 
hair 
loss 
before 
it 
have 
occur 
so 
that 
they 
can 
feel 
ready 
hair 
loss 
be 
an 
expect 
and 
anticipate 
event 
the 
woman 
we 
interview 
be 
keen 
to 
tell 
us 
about 
the 
hat 
scarf 
and 
wig 
that 
they 
have 
obtain 
in 
preparation 
for 
hair 
loss 
already 
set 
myself 
up 
with 
one 
wig 
and 
i 
have 
another 
one 
in 
the 
come 
along 
and 
about 
the 
information 
about 
the 
availability 
of 
wig 
and 
other 
they 
receive 
from 
nurse 
and 
physician 
while 
other 
study 
have 
note 
that 
woman 
cut 
their 
hair 
or 
purchase 
wig 
e.g. 
william 
et 
al. 
gallagher 
they 
do 
not 
really 
explore 
why 
woman 
engage 
in 
this 
activity 
and 
what 
it 
mean 
to 
them 
for 
the 
woman 
in 
this 
study 
this 
purchase 
be 
proudly 
present 
as 
evidence 
that 
they 
be 
come 
to 
term 
with 
the 
inevitability 
of 
hair 
loss 
and 
be 
actively 
engage 
in 
prepare 
for 
the 
process 
on 
wig 
hat 
and 
scarf 
be 
see 
as 
a 
way 
of 
become 
ready 
for 
hair 
loss 
and 
gathering 
resource 
which 
be 
use 
when 
hair 
loss 
finally 
happen 
when 
i 
go 
to 
my 
first 
chemo 
session 
i 
say 
where 
the 
wig 
lady 
i 
want 
to 
see 
the 
wig 
lady 
and 
they 
say 
oh 
see 
her 
at 
your 
next 
one 
and 
i 
say 
no 
i 
i 
want 
to 
see 
her 
today 
i 
be 
absolutely 
i 
know 
i 
cope 
for 
three 
week 
think 
my 
hair 
go 
to 
fall 
out 
and 
get 
no 
so 
she 
come 
to 
see 
me 
and 
we 
order 
it 
then 
and 
there 
go 
through 
all 
the 
color 
and 
it 
be 
great 
and 
i 
feel 
really 
happy 
she 
say 
it 
brilliant 
it 
just 
like 
your 
so 
that 
be 
good 
and 
i 
buy 
some 
scarf 
which 
i 
consequently 
hate 
but 
i 
need 
them 
i 
just 
need 
to 
be 
ready 
really 
for 
some 
simply 
have 
the 
wig 
and 
the 
scarf 
be 
enough 
to 
help 
them 
to 
feel 
ready 
for 
hair 
loss 
but 
other 
may 
want 
to 
try 
out 
their 
camouflage 
to 
ensure 
that 
it 
actually 
work 
in 
actual 
fact 
just 
have 
a 
test 
run 
i 
do 
put 
my 
wig 
on 
about 
four 
day 
ago 
i 
go 
up 
the 
and 
nobody 
look 
at 
me 
twice 
nobody 
look 
at 
me 
twice 
and 
i 
think 
this 
be 
go 
to 
be 
brilliant 
because 
gonna 
feel 
really 
that 
good 
because 
when 
my 
hair 
have 
go 
be 
fine 
building 
on 
the 
notion 
of 
affective 
rehearsal 
this 
be 
see 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
behavioural 
rehearsal 
where 
they 
gather 
resource 
and 
practice 
strategy 
to 
manage 
hair 
loss 
a 
second 
form 
of 
behavioural 
rehearsal 
be 
to 
cut 
hair 
short 
in 
anticipation 
of 
its 
really 
want 
to 
wake 
up 
one 
morning 
and 
find 
a 
load 
of 
hair 
on 
my 
pillow 
and 
like 
that 
i 
think 
get 
really 
upset 
then 
um 
whereas 
it 
very 
short 
um 
i 
think 
notice 
it 
so 
much 
do 
it 
gradually 
having 
a 
short 
be 
also 
a 
way 
of 
prepare 
other 
work 
colleague 
spouse 
and 
child 
so 
that 
it 
be 
such 
a 
great 
shock 
when 
it 
actually 
happen 
and 
so 
that 
it 
be 
a 
slow 
process 
rather 
than 
shave 
it 
off 
this 
process 
of 
behavioural 
rehearsal 
then 
allow 
some 
woman 
to 
manage 
their 
anxiety 
about 
hair 
loss 
e.g. 
about 
loss 
of 
privacy 
to 
practice 
their 
strategy 
for 
camouflage 
or 
disguise 
hair 
loss 
to 
reassure

many

in 
this

change 
that 
say 
we 
be 
indeed 
that

may 
not 
be

appropriate 
for

since 
many 
be 
likely 
to 
have 
family

employment 
responsibility 
that 
affect 
their 
ability 
to 
attend 
exercise 
facility 
on 
a 
regular 
basis 
we 
try 
to 
facilitate 
participant 
visit

the

towards 
the

the

be 
relate 
to 
the

some

the

it

we

it

we

analysis

that

it 
may 
be 
that

play 
a 
much 
role 
regard 
this 
issue 
following 
on

have 
find 
association 
between

e.g.

it 
might 
be 
that

the

well 
able

the 
determinant 
of 
exercise

in 
this 
population 
participants 
in 
sherbert

of 
white 
ethnic 
origin

therefore 
our 
finding 
should 
be 
to 
woman 
of 
other 
ethnicity 
treat 
for 
breast

with 
some 
caution 
the 
supervise 
nature 
of

it 
be 
possible 
to 
systematically

as 
well 
as 
the

this 
provide 
us 
with 
the 
opportunity 
to 
examine 
in 
detail 
the 
precise 
intensity 
and 
dose 
of 
exercise 
achieve 
by 
participant 
during 
the 
intervention 
and 
this 
be 
an 
important 
strength 
over 
previous

adequate

critical 
when 
examine 
the

an

proliferation 
of 
cell 
suggest 
that 
the 
estrogenic

of 
the 
extract 
be 
due 
to 
other 
component 
it 
have 
be 
report 
that 
glycyrrhizin 
can 
bind 
directly 
to 
mineralocorticoid 
receptor 
as 
an 
agonist 
when 
its

enough

armanini

glycyrrhizin 
be 
also 
an 
inhibitor 
of 
hydroxysteroid

which 
be 
involve 
in 
the 
conversion 
of

testosterone 
at 
a 
concentration

the 
incubation 
medium 
in

armanini

while 
this 
enzyme

involve 
in 
the 
synthesis

metabolism 
of 
androgen 
and 
estrogen 
glycyrrhizin 
do 
not

glycyrrhizin 
act

agent 
against

other 
tumor 
cell

based 
on 
this 
fact 
we 
conclude 
that 
the 
activation 
of 
rapid 
signaling 
pathway 
by 
glycyrrhizin 
occur 
independently 
of 
the 
estrogen 
receptor 
therefore 
the 
estrogenic

of

not

to

glabridin

this 
fact 
suggest 
that 
although 
glabridin 
may 
contribute 
to 
estrogenic 
activity 
of 
the 
extract 
its 
activity 
be 
modulate 
by

chalcone

component

the 
growth

of

be 
low 
than 
that 
of 
suggest 
that 
isoliquiritigenin 
partly 
contribute 
to 
estrogenic 
activity 
other 
component 
of 
the 
root 
with 
estrogenic 
activity 
such 
as 
glabrene 
and 
genistein 
be 
find 
in 
the 
extract 
at 
very 
low 
concentration 
and 
as 
they 
can 
bind 
to 
the 
estrogen 
receptor 
with 
the 
same 
affinity 
as 
glabridin 
tamir 
et 
al. 
and 
et 
al. 
they 
may 
also 
influence 
the 
estrogenic 
activity 
in 
the 
extract 
therefore 
our 
finding 
strongly 
support 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
the 
estrogenic 
activity 
of 
the 
extract 
be 
due 
to 
the 
cooperation 
of 
component 
in 
the 
extract 
such 
as 
glycyrrhizin 
glabridin 
isoliquiritigenin 
glabrene 
and 
genistein 
whose 
at 
high 
concentration 
or 
at 
low 
concentration 
activity 
can 
be 
modulate 
by 
each 
other 
the 
weak 
cytotoxicity 
of 
the 
extract 
might 
be 
much 
beneficial 
for 
the

application

a

this

allow 
patient 
to 
receive 
much 
information 
on 
their 
disease 
a 
need 
that 
be 
demonstrate 
in 
previous 
research 
this 
be 
perhaps 
the 
reason 
why 
the 
patient 
want 
the 
medical 
record 
to 
contain 
nearly 
all 
of 
the 
document 
offer 
to 
them 
i.e. 
test 
result 
report 
and 
letter 
this 
confirm 
the 
result 
of 
an 
australian 
study 
show 
that 
of 
patient 
see 
hold 
their 
own 
medical 
record 
as 
a 
mean 
of 
obtain 
information 
thus 
it 
appear 
that 
for 
the 
patient 
in 
our 
study 
hold 
their 
own 
medical 
record 
be 
the 
mean 
to 
find 
information 
on 
their 
disease 
their 
diagnosis 
their 
prognosis 
their 
chance 
of 
recovery 
and 
the 
side 
effect 
they 
may 
experience 
however 
we 
must 
consider 
the 
link 
that 
exist 
between 
patient 
desire 
to 
obtain 
information 
and 
their 
desire 
to 
participate 
one 
american 
study 
on 
cancer 
patient 
highlight 
a 
strong 
correlation 
between 
the 
preference 
of 
patient 
who 
want 
as 
much 
information 
as 
possible 
and 
their 
desire 
to 
participate 
in 
other 
have 
show 
that 
the 
desire 
to 
find 
out 
much 
information 
and 
the 
wish 
to 
participate 
be 
two 
very 
distinct 
thing 
many 
patient 
who 
want 
much 
information 
do 
not 
necessarily 
want 
to 
get 
involve 
and 
participate 
much 
our 
result 
show 
no 
significant 
difference 
between 
preference 
and 
support 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
paper 
medical 
record 
according 
to 
our 
population 
of 
patient 
medical 
record 
equally 
be 
a 
mean 
of 
improve 
communication 
in 
one 
study 
conduct 
in 
london 
patient 
confirm 
that 
by 
read 
their 
record 
the 
barrier 
between 
physician 
and 
patient 
have 
be 
break 
down 
and 
the 
level 
of 
trust 
have 
be 
heighten 
however 
contrary 
to 
this 
finding 
various 
randomized 
study 
have 
prove 
that 
medical 
record 
do 
not 
significantly 
improve 
communication 
between 
patient 
and 
physician 
in 
cancer 
care 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
there 
may 
be 
much 
opportunity 
for 
the 
patient 
expectation 
that 
record 
improve 
communication 
among 
physician 
to 
be 
meet 
a 
european 
study 
on 
female 
cancer 
patient 
show 
that 
the 
great 
cause 
for 
dissatisfaction 
be 
the 
communication 
between 
the 
hospital 
and 
the 
primary 
care 
physician 
be 
extremely 
satisfy 
satisfy 
and 
dissatisfied 
or 
extremely 
dissatisfied 
moreover 
allow 
patient 
to 
hold 
their 
record 
be 
show 
to 
be 
potentially 
beneficial 
to 
communication 
between 
healthcare 
professional 
it 
appear 
that 
the 
record 
have 
little 
impact 
on 
communication 
between 
a 
patient 
and 
his 
or 
her 
entourage 
our 
result 
show 
that 
the 
patient 
already 
share 
a 
lot 
of 
information 
with 
the 
member 
of 
their 
entourage 
who 
have 
in 
much 
case 
be 
inform 
of 
the 
disease 
this 
have 
be 
show 
in 
other 
study 
namely 
in 
france 
where 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
patient 
want 
their 
family 
to 
be 
fully 
inform 
in 
our 
study 
the 
spouse 
 
partner 
and 
child 
be 
the 
well 
inform 
they 
play 
a 
very 
important 
role 
and 
provide 
a 
vital 
of 
support 
for 
the 
cancer 
patient 
the 
other 
advantage 
accord 
to 
the 
patient 
in 
our 
study 
involve 
the 
continuity 
of 
their 
cancer 
care 
they 
see 
this 
record 
which 
contain 
all 
of 
the 
vital 
medical 
information 
as 
useful 
in 
case 
of 
emergency 
and 
as 
a 
mean 
to 
avoid 
repeat 
unnecessary 
investigation 
or 
request 
a 
second 
opinion 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
usefulness 
of 
the 
record 
in 
case 
of 
an 
emergency 
have 
be 
show 
several 
time 
in 
the 
united 
kingdom 
of 
the 
patient 
in 
study 
appreciate 
have 
write 
information 
as 
a 
mean 
to 
avoid 
their 
medical 
history 
to 
each 
new 
healthcare 
professional 
they 
meet 
meanwhile 
the 
french 
government 
have 
help 
address 
this 
need 
by 
create 
the 
cancer 
plan 
le 
plan 
cancer 
in 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
the 
coordination 
of 
care 
one 
of 
the 
key 
measure 
of 
the 
cancer 
plan 
be 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
share 
oncology 
record 
this 
record 
design 
as 
a 
mean 
to 
pass 
on 
information 
be 
accessible 
by 
both 
physician 
and 
patient 
themselves 
thus 
patient 
will 
be 
able 
to 
play 
an 
active 
role 
in 
their 
medical 
care 
should 
they 
desire 
as 
ross 
demonstrate 
our 
study 
show 
that 
patient 
prefer 
to 
emphasize 
the 
advantage 
of 
such 
medical 
record 
rather 
than 
focus 
on 
the 
disadvantage 
as 
well 
they 
appear 
to 
unanimously 
agree 
on 
the 
benefit 
of 
such 
record 
while 
have 
much 
much 
divide 
opinion 
on 
the 
drawback 
in 
effect 
they 
express 
certain 
fear 
half 
of 
them 
believe 
the 
record 
be 
lose 
whereas 
the 
other 
half 
feel 
there 
be 
little 
or 
no 
risk 
of 
this 
the 
literature 
on 
similar 
experiment 
have 
show 
that 
the 
record 
be 
rarely 
lose 
none 
be 
lose 
in 
a 
recent 
study 
conduct 
in 
the 
united 
kingdom 
and 
in 
only 
of 
case 
in 
another 
british 
study 
carry 
out 
on 
breast 
cancer 
patient 
as 
well 
the 
lose 
record 
be 
only 
copy 
and 
all 
of 
the 
original 
document 
be 
safely 
keep 
in 
the 
healthcare 
facility 
or 
with 
the 
physician 
provide 
care 
to 
the 
patient 
the 
potential 
for 
lose 
this 
record 
raise 
the 
issue 
of 
privacy 
however 
accord 
to 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
patient 
in 
our 
study 
hold 
such 
record 
present 
no 
threat 
to 
their 
privacy 
whether 
from 
their 
employer 
their 
insurance 
company 
or 
the 
people 
in 
their 
entourage 
the 
patient 
themselves 
decide 
who 
can 
or 
have 
access 
to 
their 
record 
yet 
of 
the 
patient 
feel 
that 
privacy 
be 
a 
vital 
issue 
in 
of 
the 
french 
law 
on 
patient 
right 
to 
access 
their 
medical 
record 
a 
debate 
that 
have 
be 
partly 
resolve 
by 
the 
law 
of 
august 
on 
one 
side 
patient 
association 
argue 
that 
direct 
access 
to 
their 
record 
would 
ensure 
them 
transparency 
in 
their 
medical 
care 
it 
would 
also 
enable 
them 
to 
get 
a 
second 
medical 
opinion 
if 
necessary 
and 
would 
give 
them 
piece 
of 
evidence 
if 
they 
ever 
need 
to 
assert 
their 
right 
on 
the 
other 
side 
physician 
organization 
emphasize 
the 
risk 
of 
expose 
patient 
to 
highly 
technical 
medical 
information 
that 
be 
hard 
to 
understand 
and 
to 
bear 
psychologically 
they 
also 
fear 
that 
the 
patient 
employer 
or 
insurance 
company 
would 
force 
the 
patient 
to 
pass 
the 
record 
onto 
them 
finally 
they 
also 
fear 
a 
rise 
in 
the 
number 
of 
and 
claim 
in 
fact 
this 
last 
two 
argument 
lead 
some 
physician 
to 
censor 
the 
information 
contain 
in 
the 
record 
the 
development 
of 
information 
technology 
and 
its 
increasing 
use 
in 
the 
healthcare 
field 
have 
make 
the 
use 
of 
share 
electronic 
medical 
record 
inevitable 
this 
use 
will 
likely 
encourage 
patient 
participation 
in 
the 
process 
but 
the 
benefit 
remain 
to 
be 
assess 
nonetheless 
the 
patient 
in 
our 
study 
do 
not 
seem 
ready 
to 
hold 
their 
medical 
record 
in 
electronic 
format 
and 
fewer 
than 
half 
completely 
agree 
to 
access 
their 
medical 
information 
via 
electronic 
mean 
an 
american 
study 
show 
that 
a 
little 
much 
than 
half 
of 
the 
patient 
be 
interested 
in 
their 
medical 
record 
via 
internet 
patient 
must 
be

that 
privacy 
prevention 
of 
access 
to 
personally

information 
by

integrity 
the 
completeness 
of 
the 
information 
and 
access 
to 
information 
at 
any 
time 
will 
be 
guarantee 
as 
of 
today 
this 
issue 
have 
yet 
to 
be 
fully 
resolve 
the 
participation 
rate 
suggest 
that 
patient 
be 
interested 
in 
this 
approach 
which 
concern 
them 
directly 
the 
good 
response 
rate 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
physician 
be 
ask 
to 
give 
out 
the 
survey 
to 
consecutive 
patient 
should 
provide 
a 
fair 
representativeness 
of 
the 
study 
sample 
many 
patient 
be 
in 
the 
remission 
phase 
or 
have 
be 
diagnose 
much 
than 
month 
prior 
to 
the 
study 
so 
the 
amount 
of 
time 
that 
have 
pass 
since 
the 
active 
treatment 
phase 
may 
have 
reduce 
the 
intensity 
of 
their 
reaction 
finally 
we 
have 
no 
datum 
on 
the 
patient 
anxiety 
since 
many 
study 
have 
show 
that 
the 
patient 
psychological 
state 
influence

quality 
of

in 
this

the

thus 
seem 
to 
be 
in

of 
hold

possible 
subject 
to

this

the

it

here 
we

the

further

several

the

the

cytokine

functional

natural 
killer 
cell

it 
should 
be 
note 
that 
much

describe

it

this

the 
immunological

the

may 
not 
be 
sufficient 
to

the

therefore 
we

follow 
rvt 
taking

our

that

how

this

explain 
by

it 
be 
also 
speculate 
that 
the

of 
such

during 
active

be 
suboptimal 
and 
they 
may 
be 
much

the

perhaps 
a

may 
be 
much 
clearly 
associate 
with

in 
this

the

the

the

with 
the 
disadvantage

one 
way

would 
be 
to

overlap 
the 
heart 
from 
the 
target 
volume 
thus 
allow 
the 
to 
reduce 
the 
heart 
dose 
this 
would 
result 
in 
inferior 
coverage 
of 
breast 
volume 
thus 
this 
decision

to 
be 
make 
by 
the

one

that 
of

the

we

we

digital

mammography 
it

where

incident

still 
deal 
with 
screen 
film 
mammogram 
and 
a 
proper 
evaluation 
of

mammogram 
would 
require 
the 
set 
to 
be 
display 
on 
a 
dedicate 
workstation 
irrespective 
of 
this 
reason 
we 
compare

so 
the 
finding 
be 
valid 
whether

support 
the

this

an

that

the

we

increase 
the

the

it

estimate

however 
bias

we

that 
the 
different

and 
the 
different 
type 
and 
degree 
of

affect 
this

explain 
much

theoretically 
much 
robust 
method

the

we

from

onwards 
the

they

therefore 
that 
there

we

that 
the 
little

so

those

the

to 
provide

whereas 
the 
much 
recent 
observational

provide 
by 
jonsson

tend 
towards 
high 
estimate 
although 
such 
difference 
in

attributed 
largely 
to

over 
this

be 
consistent 
with 
recent

from 
the

that

however 
it

this

this

have 
structural 
similarity 
to

the 
possible

in 
fact 
it 
have 
already 
be 
show 
that

can 
induce 
phosphorylation

in 
esophageal

cell 
the

study 
provide 
direct 
evidence 
that 
exogenous

can 
induce 
phosphorylation

the

be 
previously

we

that

induce

significantly

moreover 
the

abrogate 
the

in 
this 
finding 
strongly 
suggest 
that 
transactivation

be 
implicate 
in 
the 
effect 
of

since 
the 
expression 
of 
or 
be 
clinically 
associate 
with 
a 
poor 
outcome 
in

it 
be 
think 
that 
this 
two

system 
promote 
the 
development

this

indicate 
that

induce

in 
our 
experiment 
however 
the 
treatment 
with 
do 
not 
significantly 
reduce 
the 
effect 
of

in 
previous 
report 
suggest 
that 
leptin 
increase 
nuclear 
expression 
and 
activity 
of 
er 
in 
the 
absence 
of

which 
result 
in

in 
the 
enhancement 
of

be 
attributed 
much 
strongly 
to

report 
that 
acid 
lpa 
induce

however

some 
difference 
from

those 
study 
phosphorylation 
be 
detect 
in

minute

continue 
for

potentially 
due

the

by

moreover 
patient

interestingly 
the

the

p 
the

for 
this

be 
not

however 
a

suggest 
that 
once

their

we 
speculate 
the

be

therefore 
the

our

a

therefore 
the

to

because 
our 
standard

produce 
hot

be 
not 
conformal 
enough 
as 
have 
already 
be 
note 
because 
of 
the 
unavailability 
of

the 
anatomic

therefore 
very 
for 
this 
reason 
it 
be 
decide 
in

improve 
the

because 
the

the

thus 
it

moreover

this 
imply 
much 
effort 
to

this

that 
there 
be 
not 
much 
variation

a 
few 
patient 
however 
would 
benefit 
from 
a

a 
limitation 
of

be 
that 
it

however 
the

strongly 
dependent 
on 
the

to

we 
have

the

the

possibility

little

due

the 
chemical

under

plain 
diffusion

be 
rule 
out 
due 
to 
the 
of

entrap 
in

as 
be 
already 
show 
in 
our 
previous 
study 
with 
both 
nc 
and 
thus 
the 
biological 
elimination 
of

can 
only 
be 
a

the 
use 
of 
imaging 
to 
calculate 
elimination 
rate 
of

be 
much 
convenient 
and 
accurate 
than 
gravimetric

which 
require 
animal

moreover 
the 
imaging 
method 
unlike 
the 
gravimetric 
method 
can 
reflect 
structural 
change 
in 
the 
biomaterial 
that

cause 
a

but 
not 
a 
mass 
loss 
of

in 
a

we 
show 
that 
the

accompany 
by 
change 
in 
the 
nature

our

this 
find 
may 
indicate 
that 
in 
addition 
to 
the

their 
also
